(59:51) fun oh a ton of fun King PE and King Cube I think it's only room for one king man you know what I'm saying just cuz they're skin folk don't mean they're kin folk when I say I am God you think I'm joking or not you tell me I'm not joking I'd rather do it on camera no no no no if it's on camera we're not doing an interview why we'll explain why how do you feel about that influence that you had you better be careful we're coming for your children there buddy about
(1:00:17) marish Nation yes I'm going to do you're going to resign I'm going I've been answering your question you answer mine it's actually not my job to answer your question thank God for talk TV is not only the home of common sense it's the only place where you get the [Music] truth on TV on Radio and on your smartphone this is talk [Music] TV let let me ask you this Jonathan Friedland is a top Jewish journalist for the Guardian newspaper Pap he wrote a very interesting column last week in which he
(1:00:58) said at the root of all this you could argue you have two sets of people with just calls and they believe passionately in their Just Cause And he was sort of advising people not to take sides unless you really understand the history do you would you agree with that would you agree that both sides have legitimate just cause not with the methodology that's taken place and you've given an extremely detailed analysis of the buildup to what happened in 48 to me it's pretty clear 700 800,000 Palestinians were displaced
(1:01:36) from their homes and it should never have happened and that has been absolutely I think the root cause for so much resentment but can you at the heart of this debate agree with Jonathan that you could argue there's just cause on both sides there there's a cause on both sides but I I I'm I'm working on a tight robe here because not a Palestinian uh but from the Palestinian point of view there's a lot of people I mean there are 2.
(1:02:03) 2 million people living in Gaza there are 3.5 million people living in the West Bank there is 350,000 people lifting East and there's like six or seven million people living outside those people the Palestinian that were pushed out they do not have the right to go back right now if you meet Palestinians you'll see them wearing a necklace with a key that key is their house that they were kicked out from in yafa and he you know like my my my wife's family comes from ramla which is 50 mil from Gaza and and and according to the law those people have absolutely
(1:02:35) no right to go back even you if you are a Palestinian with an American passport they give you hell in order to go in and yet a Jewish person born anywhere in the world born in Poland born in the Ukraine no question ask he can jump on a plane land in Israel and get the the the the Israeli citizen and take a house that most probably belonged to a Palestinian so it is not just like it is an ongoing Injustice that has been happening now I mean where would you criticize if you're being fairm minded where would you
(1:03:09) criticize from 48 onwards the behavior of the Arab side well put yourself in the Arab side at 1948 you constituted 70% of the population suddenly the UN is giving you 48% of the land right not just that I mean the Arab regimes because they did terribly and see this is the thing Arab nationalism at the height of these people feed on each other you know because it's very very important to have a problem oh it's Israel and then and for is oh it's the Palestinian it's a very good distraction I mean sometimes I feel that like the
(1:03:46) Palestinian cause is very useful for both sides to stay there as attention because it's always a way to reflect but uh and this is a very important question because the in the mind of the western audience they always thought of the Palestinian resistance or the Palestinian side as like Islamic as militant no as a matter of fact some of the early suicide bombers were female Christian Palestinians because they like the r you know they were fighting for a land the whole idea of islamization of the whole cause came very later as a
(1:04:22) matter of fact you will find this very interesting because when I saw this I did not believe it this you know the fat movement which is the PLO the fat this was their uh slogan can you see you see there's a crescent a cross and a minora and they say unitary Democratic non sectarian so basically in the 1960 fat were basically marijuana smoking Tre hugger hippies and yet that didn't work right and the thing is I always hear that like Arabs were were giving two four so many chances for peace that is not true as a matter of
(1:04:59) fact all along history Israel didn't give an inch of land by peace 1974 73 War they gave back Sinai because Egypt like initiated the war 2006 they went out of uh south of Lebanon because of the resistance they have even the disengagement of of Gaza they didn't do it out of the goodness of their heart because they had too much casualties and even even even the oso Accords the peace treaty the one that Isaac raban and got the Nobel priz they did it because of the antifa so what is the message that Israel is giving to the Arabs I will
(1:05:36) never give you anything with peaceful resolution you will always have to fight for it you not think that for example I mean Bill Clinton feels this very strongly that there was a great deal to be done and Arafat just in the end having indicated the whole time that if we got to this place there would be a deal just walked away that that was the closest that everybody came and but actually I mean could Clinton have done any more than he tried to do then I am not again that's why it's very important to have people who are much more
(1:06:07) qualified than me to talk about this but two things I can say about that number one uh the the whole thing about the OA Accord there was a video for Netanyahu who was talking to the S offer 2001 and he was bragging about sabotaging the he was talking to like I sabotage it like there was going to be no peace yeah you've seen that right and in that video if you remember when when he was saying like you have to hit them hard 2001 no Hamas at the time we have they were talking about the Palestinian Authority we have to hit them we have to
(1:06:40) kill them we have to make them feel the pain and then one of them say like like BB but wouldn't America kind of je like so what the American public is easily manipulated 80% are with us it is absurd and as a new American where I can have the um privilege of being retrospectively angry I said like this guy is mocking the government who is and the people who have been with him all the time it's like oh they can be easily manipulated they can do and even by the way even Isaac Robin Isaac Robin the the one who actually did the peace out he
(1:07:15) was known famously so the way to actually beat those children is to break their bones called the broken bones policy they would like get those kids and break their bones on the FV so this has the whole idea about like Israel wanted peace and Arabs only wanted to fight is a very very bad representation think as it's gone on the will the genuine will on both sides for peace has not existed no I think it's been a deceit to the world I'm and and to the relative groups of people on both sides the official and actually a betrayal of
(1:07:46) the official stand of the Palestinian Authority and again I cannot speak it is very difficult to do this the official send of the Palestinian Authority is that we we are just happy with 22% of the land just give us like the yes there are people that this but the thing is you cannot just say okay let's talk about peace and then you take away my land let's talk about peace and there's there's a kind of like passive aggressiveness happening oh let's talk about but I'm going to build settins I'm
(1:08:11) going to suffocate your cities and your Villages see I think that has been incredibly inflammatory yes worsening the situation I think putting back the chance of peace I mean Netanyahu I interviewed Netanyahu earlier this year in the middle of a big social protests in his own country and I couldn't understand what he thought he was doing except that it seemed to me political expediency that he had to to get power uh you know again he had put a bunch of right-wing Headbangers into his cabinet who have incredibly bad records speak in
(1:08:43) an incredibly incend way about uh Palestinians for example and he did this for power and then he launched a because they were pushing in him to do it a ridiculous assault on the Integrity of the Supreme Court the independ of Supreme Court and and many Israelis rose up so Netanyahu is has become to me a big problem right and and the people that all the polling shows that Israeli people are very unhappy with Netanyahu I don't think he's ever going to actually want to forge peace and in fact I think he was instrumental with Hamas in
(1:09:18) wanting to keep them in power because he felt that that would create the split with the Palestinian two political groups and that would be good for Israel and it was leaked in a leak Hood uh conference in 2019 that he was bragging about giving Hamas money because this is a way that we can keep Palestinian divided and yet so we and we'll never have so this is a guy who was look we can agree about Netanyahu I think no but not just Netanyahu there there's a book I say most of his cabin there's a book
(1:09:46) called the fear of Peace it's by mush Zimmerman and he's an Israeli historian and he said like the average Israeli citz does not have a vision of Peace because for 70 years this is a country that has been the military war has been going on for they have been expanding because of war the milit is taking over so the whole idea of peace is not even there it's not just Netanyahu like like you have I remember you have interviewed Neftali Benet yes and I think you tweeted that like that was like a very
(1:10:19) um kind of reasonable take I don't think I said reasonable yeah yeah but like I this NE in he went after Queen R and he call a shame on Queen R I didn't say reasonable I just said this I did a fire Emoji yeah yeah I just said that what he was saying yeah I mean I was going to ask you about Queen Ryan let's ask about since you've raised it because Queen Ria accused the west of a glaring double standard she said this the first time in modern history there's such human suffering and the world is not even
(1:10:47) calling for ceasefire so the silence is deafening and to many in our region it makes the Western World complicit uh now other people said well okay if you feel that strongly why aren't you taking in any Palestinians why is Egypt not taking Palestinians why does the Arab world want to constantly attack Israel without actually offering any place to go for the Palestinians and what do you say to that that is exactly what Israel wants and that is exactly what actually starts third War I this is the war ution these
(1:11:25) are palestin these are their lands and then sudden they take them why so they being basically kicked around from their homes and now another country should take them you see what would happen imagine this now and because Israel official has been talking openly about this it's like why don't they just go in sin why they go you know what would happen those people going to be pushed in Sinai and with any population 2 million people that are living in refugee camp what do you think will happen unrest uh chaos and then after a
(1:11:56) few years the Western media will come with their cameras like oh look at those Arabs oh they're killing each other oh Israel is good that they got rid of them and then they will go to the West Bank and soly those 3.5 million people pushing into Jordan This the whole idea why does Jordan take them why does Egypt take them the same question Europe has 44 countries why don't they take Israel America has 50 states why don't they give them Florida I mean they we seem to complain about Florida the whole
(1:12:24) time why don't they just like give Israel the whole idea was like oh you're Arabs you're all the same no no no because what will happen that so Israel will move into Jordan it's like oh Saudi why don't you take the Jordanian this is not a solution this is not a solution I I hear I'm not taking a position out the way let me ask you direct I want to say something about what queen rer said okay the whole idea about like the West yeah I think that in 3 weeks Israel morally corrupted the West like no other I think the West will
(1:12:56) have a lot of time to recover because for years the West has been telling us oh look we are liberal we're all about human rights all are equal adopt our values and then suddenly but you you don't want to even to cease you don't want to even tell Israel to stop and suddenly we woke up and found McDonald's are giving free meals to the Israeli because like nothing will make you feel better after killing a bunch of Palestinian kids than a Happy Meal you know [Applause]
(1:14:11) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
(1:15:39) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what Israel will say because they say it to me every time they come on the program whoever from meu Barak to Natalia Bennett whoever it may be they
(1:16:45) say look we suffered such a catastrophic terror attack on October the 7th that we have decided we are going to get rid of Hamas there are 40,000 or so Hamas terrorists in their eyes who need to be got rid of and I do believe they're terrorists only terrorists can commit the kind of Act of terrorism we saw so can we on that point can we agree on that do you believe Hamas is a terror group it is what it is classified by America I I'm not a big fan of Hamas and they are militant group they does like stuff like are they terrorist do you
(1:17:17) think yeah cool okay okay so we agree on this so you have 40,000 of them live living in Gaza amongst the civilian population if Israel has decided to eliminate a terror group Hamas as the world did with Isis for example and I think there are a lot of parallels given the way they behave in October 7th to Isis how do you do it how do you do it if you don't do it the way Israel is currently trying to do it exactly not the way that Israel does it because if you have the one of the most advanced military powers in the world and it
(1:17:52) takes you 3 weeks 9,000 Palestinian civilian death 21,000 injured as we are talking right now Israel just bombed Galia which is a known refugee camp this it is a very this is a this is not self-defense you know like one of the most questions like does Israel have the right to defend itself this is a nov value question this is a no value question well I would ask a different point I would say not only do they have a right to defend themselves which every country would after a terror attack right but they actually have a duty and
(1:18:29) responsibility to their population to try and stop that happening again to them they've been doing and I do I do understand and I agree with that yeah but but here's the thing if it takes you all of that time all of these civilians to take out a few hundred gorilla Fighters we don't know how many of the people di we don't know it doesn't matter but you don't know and I don't know we don't know but like we don't even know if casualty numbers are correct because they're all coming from
(1:18:55) Hamas and we the health auth and we should believe Israel no no not necessarily no no I I don't believe either side but but but here's my problem with this but here's my point I don't think we should assume that we know these statistics are correct I don't think we should assume we know exactly how many children have been killed we do know a lot have been killed so the moral argument Remains the Same but we don't know how many Hamas terrorists have been killed in the last few weeks we just don't know do we so
(1:19:20) basically we're we're dealing with a very incompetent military force that has been sucking America dry for years and then they cannot do the job but how else do they get rid of himass not like that how do they do it I don't know but not like that because they've been trying you have another they have first of all I'm not a military expert second of all second of all they've been trying the same thing for years they go in they this is not an eye for an eye anymore this is an eye a limp a life a
(1:19:45) house a neighborhood a whole population for an eye they don't see I mean your your friend Ben shapira that you particularly despise oh I love bapir he's very smart yeah but you you've been very critical of him and that's fair enough I'm sure he would be of you but when I asked him about proportion he said there is I don't care about a proportionate response so let's K civilians as Hamas did this so we are going to get rid of Hamas it's it's not in his eyes it wasn't I for an i tooth
(1:20:09) for a tooth it was this group of terrorists did this and we are now going to rid the world of these terrorists and this is very important to look at things in context when you see how Israelis Talk inside their Community there was a very famous post by or edit he is the uh Speech writer of Nan he said what is so horrific about understanding that the whole Palestinians people are our enemies all of them are enemy compa we should call them kill their mother destroy their homes the homes that they raise those snakes so no snakes would be
(1:20:41) raised in this house anymore and this was reposted by Al Chet which is the Minister of wait for it justice those this it's not about Hamas anymore it is not about H they can tell you it's about Hamas but it's not about it is basically it has they have said it many times Pierce this is a way to kind of push them into Sinai this is not about eradicating Hamas this ship has sailed I am sorry but like I anybody who still believe that this is about Hamas is stupid because they I don't agree with that really no because I think but
(1:21:15) why so why are why there I tell you I don't agree there like 100 people any country any country that suffered the kind of terror attack that Israel suffered with the kind of death toll that occurred that day 1500 plus people grandmothers kids young women being raped kidnapped beheaded it's been reported and so on well you can raise an eyebrow I mean they found they found a young woman's skull right somehow Som been what about the babies that were beheaded well there was a report and you and I have this discussion on there you
(1:21:46) falsely quoted me and I wanted to clarify that with you in person you thought I'd said that 40 babies had been beheaded I never I said that did you I said it's been reported that 40 babies were killed some of whom had been beheaded that's what I said yeah totally totally different it's a very different well it is different yes you accept it um English is a second language so they're different things of course yes between saying 40 babies have been beheaded and 40 babies have been reported to been killed including some
(1:22:13) are those beheaded well apparently journalists have being shown utterly horrific okay this is this comes to a very important question about credibility again I'm not condoning what happened o but in I'm not a journalist but as a journalist wouldn't you take anything that an authority would say with a grain of thought yes especially if this Authority have a long history of lying and I'm just going to give a few example 1996 they bombed Kan it's a refugee camp they killed 106 people despite the they knew it's a
(1:22:47) refuge Camp they said oh maybe it's a one time off 2006 they W con again 2014 they killed two teenagers at checkpoint they denied as usual but CNN was there so they said we have to say it 2018 they killed a medic a Palestinian medic and they doctored they fabricated a video showing that it's someone else that he was a human shield and then can I just like finish want respond and and then 2010 they killed Ahmed orat denied it then said it's okay it's us 20121 they bombed the media office in it's not us
(1:23:20) but no I'm sorry and then 11th May 20 22 Shireen reporter your colleague she's Palestinian American citizen she was shot in the head and they provided forensic evidence and even a doctor video that it was not them it was Islamic Jihad how can I expect to believe this regime especially if the president of Israel comes down with this ridiculous ridiculous thing have you seen in there there he said okay this was reported by Sky News and it was the funniest thing I've SE so this was a call and po moment but like the cheap
(1:23:58) Edition Mr uh hok said like Isaac hok it's like we have found evidence on one of the uh um terrorist a manual to create chemical bombs and then he showed this and he showed and this is I just want to say why would a foot shoulder go in into enemy with like a manual to chemical bombing it's like is that Bob bring own beer bomb it's it's crazy and and what what you like have like local ingredients to make and then this it's like this is a manual of of course conv and let me read to you in Arabic because
(1:24:34) this is funny which basically say this is basically like a catalog for self-improvement for M I didn't know that they have life coaches so this and you know what sky new said is like we cannot confirm or any of this but we will show it anyways this is like this is a lying government so let me respond I do think the Israeli government has lied all the time right I do think they've lied I'm not going to dispute that I do think they've been caught lying I do think they said things that turned out not to
(1:25:10) be true I also think that two weeks ago a hospital was bombed and it was immediately well I'm going to tell you what I think Hamas immediately tell the world it was an Israeli airri and that 500 people were killed and that the hospital had been destroyed and then as the next couple of days go by the hospital is relatively undamaged the car park was obliterated many fewer people than 500 were killed how many people died we don't know because actually we're riing on the Palestinian health authority
(1:25:45) which is Hamas in Gaza for the figures so we don't know the number but a lot fewer people died it would appear than the 5 we don't know 50 either way it's appalling but it may not have been anywhere near as appalling as was first said by Hamas but here's the point most independent studies of what happened have concluded that it was almost certainly a militant stroke terror group inside Gaza and they fired a rocket which landed in the hospital car park and other words it wasn't an Israeli air
(1:26:18) strike so I have an issue with that because for three days before for the attack the priest and the patriarch of the hospital because it called the the Baptist Hospital said that they have received warning multip warning from Israel that they're going to hit the hospital and then at the time of the hit of the hospital one of the top AIDS of Netanyahu he tweeted about like we hit the hospital and then he deleted it and then basically like Israel Gaz lighted the world most that's why I said most independent no that's not true New York
(1:26:46) Times actually like just published something to prove that it was shot from Israel and I think it's they didn't okay numbers numbers that's not true okay the New York Times has not reported that it was Israel no they said the they haven't okay that's not true over 10 years Hamas launched 35,000 Rockets into Israel how many failed they killed 69 people and uh 25% military only part of them were civilians so over 10 years of 35,000 Rockets they killed 69 people but in one strike you want to tell me
(1:27:26) that these glorified firecrackers cause that kind of damage uh yes it looks like they did yeah okay yeah we're here good morning everybody hope you're well thanks for joining us you're watching the independent republic of Mike bra right here on talk TV welcome to Friday night with Nadine here on prime time we like to speak to the business people behind big moments good evening up Pi Morgan uncensored in New York City very impressive well played I'm 3 days into the job what have I done wrong and your face just stared

(1:30:19) do you feel about that influence that you had you better be careful we're coming for your children there buddy about Maring Nation yes I'm going to do you're going to resign I'm going I've been answering your question you answer mine it's actually not my job to answer your questions thank God for talk TV is not only the home of common sense it's the only place where you get the [Music] truth this is talk [Music] TV so the question again comes this and and so far you've ducked it so I want to
(1:30:56) ask you one more time we can both agree that the scenes in Gaza right now are horrific because I do feel that but I don't know how else Israel can eradicate Hamas than the way that they're currently trying to do it do you have an alternative for them well again we are locked in the same thing what can we do now but we don't look at what was happening over there you the best recruiter for Hamas is Israel I mean you have talked a lot about the horrible condition in Gaza I mean let's imagine like a little boy
(1:31:30) called Ramy he lives in Gaza you know he have a horrible life but like you know it's like it's not that bad I know he has a cousin in the West Bank he's living a good life he wake up in the morning and he found out that he was kidnapped by three settlers he was burned alive by curine and he was forced to drink the kerosene his name is Muhammad Abu that sers did that to him in 2016 all right you know what I'm just going to leave is I'm going to find find a way to go to Europe his aunt is an a
(1:31:56) published offer and she won a prize in the Frankfurt book fair his name is AD and now she was cancelled because of what's happened just because of her a Palestinian his other aunt in America his name she is a speech therapist and I this is close to my heart because of my son and she was uh fired because she did not want to sign the for government cont said that you cannot join BDS which I don't understand why do people choosing to protest peacefully by not buying goods from a certain country why would
(1:32:29) the United States make that its own issue so and this guy this this Ramy is being approached by join ham join us let's go kill is no no no no I don't want to kill I just I'm going to live in Gaza it's a life but 97% of water is not good for human half of the population are anemic even the is not being treated and it goes into the shores of Israel like oh those horrible so and then he and he wakes up in the morning he doesn't think about killing Jews the first thing in the morning he thinks
(1:33:00) about being there at 5:00 at the first 50 people in the line for bread because if he doesn't he will miss the food for his family and he goes back and he finds a message saying that we are going to bomb your house he comes back he loses his old family now tell me what is a proportionate response for that I don't know I don't know you cannot create terrorism and then you you have they have created this would I don't I don't know as the answer but bam let me ask you this Hamas will have known when they perpetrated what they
(1:33:32) did on October the 7th what the scale of response was likely to be how does that help the Palestinian people they are supposed to serve I don't know the wheels are already set in motion but it doesn't does it I do not you know here's the thing I feel sometimes that Hames is with us in the room that we are bringing Hamas who has the power in this equation who has the fourth largest and strongest military power the whole idea about Israel is like oh my God we are the Arabs are going to destroy us look at
(1:34:05) the map hang on let me hang on hamas's stated goal is the eradication yeah of Israel and the Jewish people yes they make no pretense about it they've made no attempt unlike the Nazis who try to cover up their crimes they've made no attempt to try and deny they brazenly boasted about it they are proud of what they did right and they will have known again that the scale of what they did in October the 7th would have prompted this kind of response which would have led to thousands of innocent Palestinians
(1:34:35) getting killed and my question for you I wish the 7th of October never happened right every time every time something you say Hamas is everywhere well yeah actually all roads all roads on this particular part of the crisis and I accept it's been going on for 75 years this conflict but all roads in this crisis lead to Hamas and what they did and and not necessarily because because all roads goes to the condition that created Hamas if the if the Jewish people were expelled from Europe and went to Argentina or South Africa and
(1:35:06) Uganda and went in and took the land you would have ham all you and I can agree that the conditions Palestinian people have had to endure in Gaza for a very long time are completely unacceptable I think it's completely unacceptable that Israel has wielded such control over the people of G working out who can come in and who can go out turning on and off Water and Power on a whim turning off the internet on and off at a whim all that kind of stuff I can completely agree with but given that I think we agree Hamas are a
(1:35:36) terror group let's say let me finish my question given that we agree that Hamas is a terror organization who have a publicly stated position of annihilating not just Israel but Jewish people and as we saw on October the 7th they mean it if you are is Israel what do you do to get rid of those people who have shown the world that's exactly what they will actually do if they get the chance you know what I would do I would give the Palestinians what they deserve terrorism is a virus yes it's a virus I agree if a patient with a flu
(1:36:13) came to you and you're a doctor how can you treat that patient how do you treat as a doctor how do you do well you're the doctor you give them nutrition yeah fluids and rest so the immunity of the body gets rid of the virus on its own M if I received that patient with a flu and I took a sledam I like why are you not getting better do you think that patient will get better no you are weakening him you are making him worse I think if you have two groups of people who are ideologically wedded to your destruction
(1:36:46) as a state and as a populace and you're constantly firing Rockets as mass have done for over decade now then that cannot be acceptable you have to stop that right these are terrorists who've now shown on October the 7th their true colors they don't just talk about wanting to kill all Jewish people they are going to do it if they get the chance so I don't believe Hamas can possibly stay in any position of authority in Gaza I think that would be ruinous for not just the people of Gaza but also for Israelis so if you're going
(1:37:17) to get rid of them which many people think on both sides is is inevitable and should happen as a consequence of what they did the big question is how do you do that and I don't know any other way other than the way Israel is currently doing hence my personal moral quandry about this so if a terrorist takes over the Empire State instead of taking him out we bomb the whole empire state well that's the question isn't it proportion that is not even a question that was not even a question because that would be
(1:37:45) ridiculous you talk about you talk about the normalization of the region I mean the theory that I most buy into support Ed by recent I think Wall Street Journal reporting that hundreds of Hamas terrorists had gone to Iran for training before this attack it obviously been very carefully organized and so that is I think highly likely but if you're Iran and you're looking at all this normalization and you're looking at Saudi Arabia being next this is your worst nightmare so a perfect time to commit an atrocity like this through
(1:38:16) your proxy of Hamas again I'm not a political expert to know what is the background but let me tell you theory is Hamas justifi is all of the horrible conditions that Palestinians are living in is that a justification for Hamas doing what they did good do you think so of course not right so we're agreed no of course and it may well be here by the way as I've said that if Israel pursues this ground Invasion it backfires horribly it leads to a much wider conflict involving many other people possibly including Iran directly and it
(1:38:51) could be a horrendous escalation and a massive war raging through the whole region and that is my fear about it but I come back to the central point of justification and I'm really struggling to see what else Israel is supposed to do to get rid of Hass and if you've got an alternative let's hear it I do Pierce this is never about Hamas believe me it is never about hes if somebody tells you who they are listen is has been telling the world all the time they need to clear the gaza's STP into Egypt you think that's always
(1:39:27) been the plan always there I mean they have said it they have said it many times why does why does Egypt take them and do you think when Egypt takes them do you think they go back no never and then when they're done with Gaza they will go back to the West Bank they will kind of like build the settlements around them and then until they push them into Jordan because that is the plan they have talken not just benam everybody so like there's no state two state it is one state and is for the Jew I don't think he believes in a two-state
(1:39:55) solution nobody believes in a two- State solution [Applause] [Music] [Music]
(1:41:03) [Music] e [Music] [Music]
(1:42:15) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay let's let's move forward oh yeah let's let's assume somehow we get to a place possibly at the instigation of
(1:43:20) countries like Sou Arabia and others getting directly involved where you get to a place where Hamas are removed and I don't quite see how that happens without enormous further Bloodshed but let's assume they get removed let's assume that Netanyahu is removed from office which I think is highly likely just from the fury of his own people about what they see as the defensive and security failings plus his attack on the Supreme Court already causing huge polarization let's assume we get new leadership in
(1:43:47) both places could there still be peace could there still no because Israel have already shown it's not about Nyah it is the policy of Israel not to give the Palestinian their seat it has always been there but what if you find leadership that understands you will not but why why are you so not do you not see there's any chance of doing that here no not with Israel Obama after he left office he wrote in his book The problem with the Palestinian Israeli conflict is that that one side is extremely powerful and one side is
(1:44:21) extremely weak there is absolutely nothing to oblige that strong side to give anything all over the years Israel showed you many times that they are not interested in peace leave Gaza forget Hamas for a second the West Bank what have they been doing in the West Bank the illegal settlements did not stop a single day are and it's completely wrong yeah yeah yeah but but but the thing wrong but you see what they're doing in the West Bank right now they are creating little gas they are creating little gas yeah and until they like
(1:44:51) squeeze them there was there and it's completely wrong there is a hilarious documentary called The Wanted 18 it is like an Israeli Palestinian co-production and it tells about the incredible story about the residence of bahur it's a Palestinian town next to the na and uh they said they don't want to depend on the milk coming from the kaputs so they bought 18 cows 18 cows and they didn't know how to milk the cows or we have a a cow farm so so they were like engineers and and and doctors they send people to kind of like to
(1:45:23) learn how to do the farm so they bought the cows and they started to produce milk and they started to sell the milk to The Villages the Israeli authorities were not very comfortable so one day the military government came in us like those cows and I quote constitutes an exis threat to the National Security of the state of Israel you need to get rid of them and the movie goes about like the hilarious attempts of hiding those cows between The Butchers and the houses and in one scene that a cow is actually running and the the Israeli soldiers are
(1:45:54) like running behind it and they corner it and they corner it and they about to kill it and you know what did the cow say you didn't fall for this cows don't speak yeah but you know it actually said something you know what did it say it said but anyways but you see this is the ideology of the Israeli ruling but they are not interested they're not even allowing you to get your own cows but this comes back to what you were saying at the start which is about the hate on both sides no no no I'm not talking about the hate on
(1:46:27) I'm talking about this shining example that Israel W tell the that we are like the Western World we are secular I don't know if you know this but they're not just like secular like RAC against their own Arab I'm talking about like Arabs with Palestinian with Israeli identity I'm talking about them being even racist against their own people 1950 Yemen's immigrants that came from Yemen and they were in the transition Camp waiting to be transformed into Israel their kids were taken away from them and given to
(1:46:57) White Ashkenazi Jews because they were not white enough but Bon what would happen if a Jewish person went to Gaza how can why would they go to G and exactly even I wouldn't go to G exactly that's my point yeah it's a dystopia who but like but I'm just it's not just raising points about Israel making out that somehow there is bad or Worse what's going on there the pales inessive way imag absolutely but you know what Hamas never claimed that they are the only democracy in the in the in the region they never claim
(1:47:30) that they are secular they never said that they adopt Western CH and they definitely definitely they did not use that lie in order to car to bom a whole country now here I want to one example and I'm going to leave you Israel you think that Israel will like by the way the whole thing about the many children you can find it in New York Times it's called like the uh the Lost Children of Israel the Forgotten uh but even when Ethiopian people were immigrated to Israel Ethiopian Jews women then Report 2013 that's is
(1:48:01) not like 50 years ago they reported that they were given against their consent and without their knowledge contraceptive shots so they wouldn't reproduce because they are the wrong color Israel is is a racist apartheid country that is projecting this shiny example of secularism and democracy for the people so people can accept whatever they do because they look at Palestinians as lesser people this is the whole point this is the whole point and I would like to quote Winston Churchill he had a quote that say I
(1:48:37) don't believe that we have made a great wrong to the red Indians of America or the black people of Australia because they were replaced by a higher race a stronger race a more World wisely race this is this is why why Queen R is criticizing the West this is why we here said like where are your values because this is the Crux of the problem it's not Hamas it's not Palestine it is people looking at us as lesser human beings b i and I don't dispute the characterization that a lot of the Israel Administration
(1:49:11) look upon Palestinians as lesser people otherwise they wouldn't they even look at Jews and Y Jews Like Les I wouldn't dispute that um I want to quote you to end this no why would you end this don't end this we'll be talking for two hours why not at some point amazing time do another interview well this one goes big um I think this is a neat way to end it he said I actually believe there is a middle ground between everybody and they can meet I direct my criticism for the extreme of each one of them that was you
(1:49:42) Bassam youf m i I agree with that but I don't share your view there can never be peace in this region I think they can't be with the current leadership structures in both countries or both places but I definitely think you've got to be optimistic about peace you just need to find people for it I hope so but the reason listen I refused to come on my on your show when your producer first called me for the first interview because I was scared I was afraid for me that was a career suicide because and and I have I'm talk this is even
(1:50:23) important because you are someone who's always talked about like against cancel about like talking speaking your mind out speaking your mind out I left Egypt and I came to America the land of the free the home of the brave but I didn't know that there was a fine print said that you cannot speak about Israel I have issue with that Israel is a foreign country their allies good you speak about Israel how many people lost their jobs even she's she by the way she hasn't lost her job no no but she talked about
(1:50:54) death threats she's talking about like being silenced by the B is she's Palestinian and you know who else sisters I love theth they are with us yeah anyway so I know them both are very nice people yeah but but the thing is if if you are that high and you cannot speak about it and it's not about well you can you just have to yeah you can I mean I've spoken out about these issues and you get shot at not literally but metaphorically all day long on social media that shouldn't stop people from doing it
(1:51:22) I'm just like wondering as an as an American yeah but I I'm doing now because like the first interview went well I'm doing that because I want people to see that you can really speak up and not just get canceled but get rewarded my career is going fine yeah it's great because I want people to have the courage why are there should be no limits I'm I'm I'm kind of like so so confused as an American citizen why every American president cand presidential candidate have to go and kiss the hand and bend the knees to
(1:51:54) APAC this is a Lobby that works for a foreign country interest why don't we have like a Lobby for Saudi Arabia at is they giving us more money you know the great thing you can say that here yes you couldn't say in Egypt that's why you're living here yes but again a lot of people feel the burn the heat whenever they come but if I was an American I'd be going all right bassim all right we'll take the criticism because you can do that in this country and I'm happy when you criticize the
(1:52:17) government in your own country yeah they drove you out yes and that's why I came to America to play The White Man's game to actually to to to pass this acquired white privilege to my children but the problem it's not just a country of white people but here's the problem and the white man's game the the game in America is not a white man's game it's a game that actually has a democracy and believes in Freedom of spee there dog whistles everywhere you're not going to be put in jail for this interview or I
(1:52:42) can lose my career and I can lose jobs and you know that you couldn't in Egypt you could no here you Egypt they arrested you here you and they threatened you and you would have ended up in prison or dead here a lot of people lost their jobs because they spoke up it depends what they say of course but again if you're cany West and you spew anti-semitic I'm I will never adopt that kind of point of view but the thing is there is dog whistles everywhere as I told you at the beginning you cannot just say like
(1:53:09) antiem an like I mean now the how come that the Palestinian flag is outload by the way it's outload in Israel if you raise the a you go to jail and now they're saying like the Palestinian flag is a pramas no it's not a pramas you know I was in I was doing a comedy show in Arizona and a guy was like wearing like a cof like a scarf and I took it and and I'm not like in Hyperbole and like wearing symbols but I just want because like why are we are we going to Outlook colors and flags that is that
(1:53:39) that is absurd that is not right I don't I agree I don't think you should but you should certainly Outlaw Hamas regard they're already Outlaw I mean I'm not supporting teror group okay okay but the people with the power the people who supposedly have the and you should by the way I will say this you should be able to criticize Israeli government without being accused of being anti-semitic I have in this interview repeatedly and I'm not anti-semitic I just have a problem with a lot of what
(1:54:05) the Israeli government's been doing and I have a problem with how any criticism to Israel by some circles here are considered anti-semite this is not fair yeah but a lot of the people doing it are actually anti-semitic yes but also a lot of zionists are against Israel that they HTE the Jews you know it it it we've discussed that I want to end on a happy but before I want to just like say two words about the media which is please sure uh Mr zlot the Palestinian ambass that you have this guy lost six members
(1:54:37) of his family in an Israeli strike and when he went on like some British news thing he sat down and and and and and the lady told him like we are very sorry for personal f I'm sure you don't condem the killing of Israeli civilians what in the same moment there's another girl like called diara Aid she was like on Sky News and and the girl was like cry like I lost 30 members of my family 17 of them are children I lost my best friend I and then what do you think would happen is forget about empathy a lot of people
(1:55:11) what about manners well I think you have to stop I've said this repeatedly you have to start from a place of humanity you have to look at what happened on October the 7th and feel utterly outraged and disgusted for the loss of human life and you also have to feel that for what's happening in Gaza to innocent people and if you don't if you can't feel both for both sets of people both sets of innocent people being killed if you can't feel a sense of of Despair and horror over their death you
(1:55:41) don't have any Humanity believe me Pierce believe me Pierce it's not really about that there's a deep sentiment in the Middle East in Arabs that the West do not look at us as equals well you know what so what I did I went to the machines yeah and I asked Chad gbt simple questions do Israelis deserve to be free and you know what they tell me yes israelies deserve the right like any other people and then I asked the same question do Palestinians deserve to be free and you know what they tell me it is complex it is a sensitive issue well
(1:56:16) it's not complex it's not sensitive the Palestinian people should be free yeah but the ma be finished and they should have exactly the same rights to freedom and freedom of expression and a way to lead their lives and to water and to power and to Internet that Israelis have and we have here in America and we have back in my home country of the UK and I want that for the Palestinian people we've got to end it there okay mainly because I've worked up a hell of a hunger in two hours of interview and you
(1:56:44) have brought your wife's cooking holler so tell me again how I do this okay so basically take a piece of this put it in the olive oil yes which is from the West Bank yeah from the west bank and then a little bit of this yes are that yes yes this is like amazing oil coming from the Olive Tree uh this is come from the West Bank since 1967 Israel have actually uprooted 800,000 Olive Tree just to that is absolutely delicious I know please thank your wife for me thank you wish her all the best and her family
