You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:


{
  "stated_goals": [], 
  "main_motivations": [], 
  "possible_actions": [], 
  "good_scenarios": [
    {
        "item": "stock surge during times of geopolitical tension",
        "quote": "For starters defense company General Dynamics has witnessed a surge in purchases this isn't entirely unexpected defense stocks often become attractive during times of geopolitical tension"
    }
  ], 
  "bad_scenarios": [], 
  "main_fears": [], 
  "resources": [], 
}


=== RESULTS ===

The error with your JSON string is the trailing comma in the last item of the JSON object. JSON does not allow trailing commas. 

Here's the fixed version:

```
{
  "stated_goals": [], 
  "main_motivations": [], 
  "possible_actions": [], 
  "good_scenarios": [
    {
        "item": "stock surge during times of geopolitical tension",
        "quote": "For starters defense company General Dynamics has witnessed a surge in purchases this isn't entirely unexpected defense stocks often become attractive during times of geopolitical tension"
    }
  ], 
  "bad_scenarios": [], 
  "main_fears": [], 
  "resources": [] 
}
