Page name: Bassem Youssef
Long description: Bassem Raafat Mohamed Youssef (Arabic: باسم رأفت محمد يوسف, Egyptian Arabic: [ˈbæːsem ˈɾɑʔfɑt mæˈħæmmæd ˈjuːsef]; born 21 March 1974) is an Egyptian comedian, television host, and surgeon. He is best-known in his media career for having hosted Al Bernameg, a satirical comedy show focused on Egyptian politics, from 2011 to 2014. Youssef's comedic style has led to him being dubbed "Egypt's Jon Stewart" after Stewart's satirical The Daily Show, which had itself inspired Youssef to pursue a career in television. In 2013, Youssef was named on Time 100. His current projects include The Democracy Handbook and Revolution For Dummies.
