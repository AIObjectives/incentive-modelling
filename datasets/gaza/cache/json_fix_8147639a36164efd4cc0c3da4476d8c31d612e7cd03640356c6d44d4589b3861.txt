You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

Apologies but the document provided does not offer direct insights related to the questions about Presidency of Bill Clinton. The document is a transcript of a YouTube video featuring Bassem Youssef and does not make any references to the stated goals, motivations, actions, scenarios, fears, and resources during the presidency of Bill Clinton. Please provide a relevant document in order to extract useful and accurate insights.

=== RESULTS ===

The provided string is not in a JSON format. However, I can convert it into a valid JSON for you.
Here it is:

```json
{ 
    "message": "Apologies but the document provided does not offer direct insights related to the questions about Presidency of Bill Clinton. The document is a transcript of a YouTube video featuring Bassem Youssef and does not make any references to the stated goals, motivations, actions, scenarios, fears, and resources during the presidency of Bill Clinton.
