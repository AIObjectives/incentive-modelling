You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [
      {
        "item": "Mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas",
        "quote": "And there are intense negotiations going on, not directly between Hamas and Israel, because they don’t have formal relations. But mediated by Qatar, and to some extent, Egypt." 
      }
  ],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": [],
}

=== RESULTS ===

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [
      {
        "item": "Mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas",
        "quote": "And there are intense negotiations going on, not directly between Hamas and Israel, because they don’t have formal relations. But mediated by Qatar, and to some extent, Egypt." 
      }
  ],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": []
}
