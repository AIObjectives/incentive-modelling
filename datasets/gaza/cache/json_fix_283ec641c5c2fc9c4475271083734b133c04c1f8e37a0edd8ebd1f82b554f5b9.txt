You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

The document provided does not contain any information about Alan Daniels. Therefore, it's not possible to answer the questions based on the provided document.

=== RESULTS ===

As you've provided a clear text, not an invalid JSON string, it can't be directly converted into a JSON object. A suggested JSON object representing your provided text could be:

```
{
  "document": {
    "content": "The document provided does not contain any information about Alan Daniels.",
    "conclusion": "Therefore, it's not possible to answer the questions based on the provided document."
  }
}
```
