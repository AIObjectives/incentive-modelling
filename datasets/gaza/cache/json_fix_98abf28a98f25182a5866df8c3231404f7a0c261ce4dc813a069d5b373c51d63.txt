You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:


{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [{"item": "Support for Israel", "quote": "Even isolationist Republican voices such as Vivek Ramaswamy and Marjorie Taylor Greene have come out in strong support of Israel, suggesting that at least for now the U.S. stands united behind restoring Israeli deterrence through a strong response."}],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": [], 
}
