You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

I'm sorry, but your document does not provide any detailed information about Washington, D.C. directly. The document is a transcript of a New York Times Podcast that talks about the situation in Israel and Gaza, but Washington, D.C. is not specifically mentioned. Can you please provide a relevant document or further instructions so I can assist you better?

=== RESULTS ===

This text doesn't appear to be in a JSON structure. However, I will convert it into a valid JSON object for you:

```json
{
  "message": "I'm sorry, but your document does not provide any detailed information about Washington, D.C. directly. The document is a transcript of a New York Times Podcast that talks about the situation in Israel and Gaza, but Washington, D.C. is not specifically mentioned. Can you please provide a relevant document or further instructions so I can assist you better?"
}
