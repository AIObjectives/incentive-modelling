You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

The document does not provide any information about an individual named Alan Daniels. Therefore, answering the provided questions is not possible based on this document.

=== RESULTS ===

The given input is narrative text, not a JSON string. If you want to convert this into a JSON object, you could think of structuring it in this way:

```JSON
{
  "comment": "The document does not provide any information about an individual named Alan Daniels. Therefore, answering the provided questions is not possible based on this document."
}
```
