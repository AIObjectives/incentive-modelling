You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

I must respectfully inform you that while the provided document discusses the military and political situation involving Israel, Gaza, Hamas, and the US, it doesn't mention Mosul or reveal insights relevant to the specified questions about this city in northern Iraq. Consequently, it's not possible to provide a response in the desired format. Please provide another document that includes information concerning Mosul.

=== RESULTS ===

Since the provided text is not in JSON format, I will transform it into a valid JSON structure as requested:

```
{
  "message": "I must respectfully inform you that while the provided document discusses the military and political situation involving Israel, Gaza, Hamas, and the US, it doesn't mention Mosul or reveal insights relevant to the specified questions about this city in northern Iraq. Consequently, it's not possible to provide a response in the desired format. Please provide another document that includes information concerning Mosul."
}
