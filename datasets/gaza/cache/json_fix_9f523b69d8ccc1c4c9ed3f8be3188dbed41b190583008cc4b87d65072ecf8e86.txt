You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

Here's the fixed JSON:

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": []
}

=== RESULTS ===

The string you provided already represents a syntactically valid JSON. It is a JSON object empty arrays allocated to different keys. Thus, no changes are needed.
