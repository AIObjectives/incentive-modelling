You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": []
} 

Unfortunately, the provided document doesn't provide specific information related to Iraq. The entire document discusses the situation between Israel and Gaza, and not Iraq.

=== RESULTS ===

Your information seems to be irrelevant to the problem statement. The JSON string provided is already syntactically valid. There are no modifications required. However, if you would like to add details about Iraq, more context or specific fields are needed for the JSON file.
