 I have used the Wikipedia API to extract some description for a page but the description is a bit long: 

``` 
Page name: Israeli
Long description: Israeli may refer to:

Something of, from, or related to the State of Israel
Israelis, citizens or permanent residents of the State of Israel
Modern Hebrew, a language
Israeli (newspaper), published from 2006 to 2008
Guni Israeli (born 1984), Israeli basketball player


```

Return a more concise description. Aim for a single sentence, roughly 2 or 3 lines. 


=== RESULTS ===

"Israeli" refers to something or someone from the State of Israel, can denote the Modern Hebrew language, or may reference a newspaper published from 2006 to 2008, or the Israeli basketball player, Guni Israeli.
