You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

Sorry, as per your question and the given document, the document does not provide specific information about the Gaza Strip's stated goals, main motivations, possible actions, good and favorable scenarios, bad and unfavorable scenarios, main fears and concerns, and resources at their disposal. The document discusses the war between Israel and Palestine and how it is exploited for profit, with emphasis on how members of US Congress may be investing in the military and defense sector.

=== RESULTS ===

It seems you want this information represented as a JSON object. Here's one possible interpretation:

```json
{
    "Query": "Gaza Strip's stated goals, main motivations, possible actions, good and favorable scenarios, bad and unfavorable scenarios, main fears and concerns, and resources at their disposal",
    "Response": "Sorry, as per your question and the given document, the document does not provide specific information.",
    "Document_contents": "The document discusses the war between Israel and Palestine and how it is exploited for profit, with emphasis on how members of US Congress may be investing in the military and defense sector."
}
