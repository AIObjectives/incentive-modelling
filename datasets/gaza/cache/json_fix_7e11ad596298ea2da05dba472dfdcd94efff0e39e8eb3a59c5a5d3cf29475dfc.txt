You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": [], 
}
Unfortunately, the document provided doesn't contain direct information related to the outlined questions about Iran. The main focus of the transcript is a conversation about the Israel-Palestine conflict and other topics unrelated to Iran.

=== RESULTS ===

There seems to be some confusion since the text is not related to the JSON structure provided. However, I can fix the provided JSON string. The only issue here is an unnecessary comma after the last element. It should look like this:

```json
{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": []
}
```
