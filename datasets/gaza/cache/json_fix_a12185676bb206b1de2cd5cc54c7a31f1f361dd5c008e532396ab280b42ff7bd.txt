You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

I'm sorry but the document you have provided does not contain specific information related to China regarding your asked questions. Therefore, it would not be possible to provide a suitable response as per the outlined format. 

However, if you could provide a document that includes information in relation to the desired topics, I'd be happy to help analyze it!

=== RESULTS ===

The given string cannot be converted into JSON format without structured data. However, as per your requirement, I'm providing an example of this text in JSON format.

```json
{
  "response": {
    "text": "I'm sorry but the document you have provided does not contain specific information related to China regarding your asked questions. Therefore, it would not be possible to provide a suitable response as per the outlined format.",
    "suggestion": "However, if you could provide a document that includes information in relation to the desired topics, I'd be happy to help analyze it!"
  }
}
