You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [{"item": "Not specified in the document", "quote": "N/A"}], 
  "main_motivations": [{"item": "Profit from war conflicts", "quote": "defense company General Dynamics has witnessed a surge in purchases this isn't entirely unexpected defense stocks often become attractive during times of geopolitical tension"}], 
  "possible_actions": [{"item": "Continue to profit from geopolitical tensions", "quote": "defense company General Dynamics has witnessed a surge in purchases this isn't entirely unexpected defense stocks often become attractive during times of geopolitical tension"}], 
  "good_scenarios": [{"item": "Increase in conflicts and wars globally", "quote": "defense company General Dynamics has witnessed a surge in purchases this isn't entirely unexpected defense stocks often become attractive during times of geopolitical tension"}],
  "bad_scenarios": [{"item": "Decrease in global conflicts and wars", "quote": "defense stocks often become attractive during times of geopolitical tension"}], 
  "main_fears": [{"item": "Not specified in the document", "quote": "N/A"}],
