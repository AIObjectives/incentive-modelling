You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON.

{
  "message": "I am sorry, but the document does not provide any specific information about Israel that could be used to answer the questions. Please provide a document that contains relevant information about Israel."
