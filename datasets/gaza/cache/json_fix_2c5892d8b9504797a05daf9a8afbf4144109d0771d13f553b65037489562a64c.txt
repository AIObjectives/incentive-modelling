You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

Apologies for any misunderstanding, but the document provided does not contain specific information related to Los Angeles. It's a transcript of an interview with Bassem Youssef, focusing primarily on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

Since you requested information about Los Angeles, I suggest providing a document directly related to the city's goals, motivations, actions, resources, and scenarios. This way, I can provide an accurate analysis based on the provided document.

=== RESULTS ===
