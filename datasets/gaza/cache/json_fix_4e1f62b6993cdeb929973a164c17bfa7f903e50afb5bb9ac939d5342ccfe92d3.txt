You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": []
}

This document does not provide enough information about Vivek Ramaswamy to answer your questions. The only mention of him is the statement: "Even isolationist Republican voices such as Vivek Ramaswamy and Marjorie Taylor Greene have come out in strong support of Israel, suggesting that at least for now the U.S. stands united behind restoring Israeli deterrence through a strong response."

=== RESULTS ===

Your string includes both JSON data and a plain text paragraph. These two cannot coexist without proper separation and structuring. I will therefore encapsulate both into a dictionary in a valid JSON structure. Here you go:

```
{
  "json_data": {
    "stated_goals": [],
    "main_motivations": [],
    "possible_actions": [],
    "good_scenarios": [],
    "bad_scenarios": [],
    "main_fears": [],
    "resources": []
  },
  "text": "This document does not provide enough information about Vivek Ramaswamy to answer your questions. The only mention of him is the statement: 'Even isolationist Republican voices such as Vivek Ramaswamy and Marjorie Taylor Greene have come out in strong support of Israel, suggesting that at least for now the U.S. stands united behind restoring Israeli deterrence through a strong response.'"
