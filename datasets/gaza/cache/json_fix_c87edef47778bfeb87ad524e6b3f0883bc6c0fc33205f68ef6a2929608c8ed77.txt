You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

Based on the provided document, it does not contain any specific information answering your questions about Nikki Haley. The entire document is a conversation between Bassem Youssef and Piers Morgan, predominantly about the political situation in Egypt and issues in the Middle East more broadly, with references to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Therefore, it's not possible to provide answers to your queries based on this document. We would need a document that specifically discusses Nikki Haley's goals, motivations, possible actions, scenarios, fears, and resources.
