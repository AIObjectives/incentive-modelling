You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [
    {"item": "May influence Hamas operations in Gaza", "quote": "And Hamas is backed by Iran. So there’s a fear that they might get involved even more than they already have done."}
  ], 
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": [
    {"item": "Sponsorship of Hamas", "quote": "And Hamas is backed by Iran."}
  ], 
}

=== RESULTS ===

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [
    {"item": "May influence Hamas operations in Gaza", "quote": "And Hamas is backed by Iran. So there’s a fear that they might get involved even more than they already have done."}
  ], 
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": [
    {"item": "Sponsorship of Hamas", "quote": "And Hamas is backed by Iran."}
  ]
