You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

The provided document does not discuss in detail Jared Kushner's goals, motivations, possible actions, good and bad scenarios, fears, or resources. However, there is a minor reference to Kushner in the context of the Abraham Accords. 

Here is the extracted information in the requested format: 

    {
      "stated_goals": [],
      "main_motivations": [],
      "possible_actions": [],
      "good_scenarios": [],
      "bad_scenarios": [],
      "main_fears": [],
      "resources": [
          {
            "item": "Influence in the Abraham Accords",
            "quote": "This time, by all accounts, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States were inching closer towards a transformative three-way deal [...] the transformation of the region which had started with the Abraham Accords shepherded by Jared Kushner, which the first author helped advise and participated in [...]"
          }
      ]
    }

=== RESULTS ===

Your string is already in a valid JSON format. The only improvement that could be made is to remove the initial text preceding the JSON object since JSON cannot contain plain text. Here's the fixed string:

```json
{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": [
    {
      "item": "Influence in the Abraham Accords",
      "quote": "This time, by all accounts, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States were inching closer towards a transformative three-way deal [...] the transformation of the region which had started with the Abraham Accords shepherded by Jared Kushner, which the first author helped advise and participated in [...]"
    }
  ]
}
