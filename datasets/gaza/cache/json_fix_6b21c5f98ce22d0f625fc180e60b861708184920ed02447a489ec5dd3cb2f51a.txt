You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

The document does not provide any specific information on Benjamin Netanyahu's stated goals, main motivations, possible actions, scenarios considered good or bad for him, main fears and concerns, or resources at his disposal. The document primarily focuses on Bassem Youssef's perspective on Israel and Palestine. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information based on this document. 

{
  "stated_goals": [], 
  "main_motivations": [], 
  "possible_actions": [], 
  "good_scenarios": [], 
  "bad_scenarios": [], 
  "main_fears": [], 
  "resources": [], 
}

=== RESULTS ===

The given string is almost correct but there is a trailing comma after the last item in the JSON object which is incorrect syntax. The corrected JSON string should be:

```json
{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
  "main_fears": [],
  "resources": []
}
```
