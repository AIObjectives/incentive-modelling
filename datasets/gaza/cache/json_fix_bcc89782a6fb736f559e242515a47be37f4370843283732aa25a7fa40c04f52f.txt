You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

Unfortunately, the provided document does not contain specific information about Israel according to the defined categories (stated goals, main motivations, possible actions, good scenarios, bad scenarios, main fears, and resources). Therefore, I cannot provide a valid JSON response as there are no quotes from the document relevant to these categories related to Israel.

=== RESULTS ===

{
  "message": "Unfortunately, the provided document does not contain specific information about Israel according to the defined categories (stated goals, main motivations, possible actions, good scenarios, bad scenarios, main fears, and resources). Therefore, I cannot provide a valid JSON response as there are no quotes from the document relevant to these categories related to Israel."
