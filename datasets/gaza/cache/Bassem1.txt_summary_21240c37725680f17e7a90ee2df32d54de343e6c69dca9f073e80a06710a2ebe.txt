Transcript:
(00:02) [Music] on TV on radio and on your smartphone this is talk TV tonight on PE Morgan un sensored it was two weeks ago that I interviewed Bassam USF the Egyptian comedian and political commentator dealing with Israel is so difficult it's like being in a relationship with a narcissistic psychopath and that interview became the biggest in our show's history with more than 20 million people so far watching it I've been answering your question you answer mine it's actually not my job to answer your questions so we decided to
(00:59) sit down again and this time here in Los Angeles where Bassam lives because of our interview I sold out Arizona really yes and we talked for nearly 2 hours about the Israel Palestine War about the 75e conflict this was basically pushed on us by the Europeans and it was a fascinating it's not about Hamas anymore it is not about H they can tell you it's about challenging no they didn't though num they didn't numbers that's not true and revealing conversation all roads in this crisis lead to Hamas and what they
(01:33) did and and not necessarily because because all roads goes to the condition that [Music] created well basson Piers it's good to see you it's good to see you to um last time obviously we did it remotely yes you were here I was in London and you complained that it was an unfair situ situation you couldn't see me your earpiece kept falling out yes so I thought okay fair enough I hear you I got on a plane I flew 6 and half thousand miles and not only that we're doing it in somewhere that is very familiar to you it's The Comedy Store in
(02:15) Los Angeles where you performed many times as a standup so I've done my bet you did you did but actually this not this is not the first time we meet in person no no we did originally in London last year and I know that many people are watching this for the first time I would know this but like I would really love to tell the story of that moment because uh I was having a a tour in the UK and Europe and I was doing my English standup and one of my uh you know advertis promotion plan was to come on your show so my Asian con is like B
(02:48) you're going to be on Pierce Morgan I said damn it's like what's wrong it's like well uh Pierce Morgan blocked me on Twitter and he said like what did you do I said well during January 6th you know Direction you know uh you tweeted something about it and I was so angry at what's happening and I remember you having you and Donald Trump in a picture and I said said the guy who had Donald Trump with him whatever and then I I I used like very harsh words and of course you block me so I and then I said like
(03:16) does he know I don't know does he know I don't know does he know I don't know so I walked into the studio and the moment I was like being seated and there preparing before we go on air and you said oh hi Basim it seems that you have more followers than me but it seems that I blocked you why and I told you and then we we said the story on air and it was funny because I made the J us like you have always been standing against canceled culture and you just canceled me theer but we agreed that this is not canceling
(03:47) because this is your own space and you're free but now you're unblocked me and we are and we're here we're here and it was yeah and actually we agreed about January the 6th by the way just for the record um the I was done about you maybe you weren't surprised I was completely staggered by the response globally to our interview several weeks ago were you taken back by the scale of it uh yes of course but I understand why um for many years the media covering the Middle East has uh been um showing a certain point
(04:20) of view I'm not going to say bias but I would say it did not allow certain voices certain um voices from the other side to be heard and that is why see the frustration you all whenever you speak to people in the Middle East they tell you the same thing uh they they they not very happy with the the coverage from because our voices are not heard now I am the least qualified person ever to talk about this conflict and yet just because I relate some of the talking points that we say and we hear the whole time people felt hurt and when you when
(04:56) people have this feeling they they're happy they are they have this response they like oh my God for the for the first time the West are actually hearing our point of view some of the point of view might not be go well with other people but at least we have a conversation and I think that is the reason why people reacted that way yeah it's it's such an incend subject matter I've never seen social media so Ablaze with hostility on on both sides did you actually as well as enormous praise from
(05:28) the Arab world did you also get criticized by some parts of the Arab world for not going perhaps hard enough oh you didn't do that you didn't do that thing is this is like uh your damn if you do you them if you not right if you don't speak up why don't you speak up if you speak up you didn't speak up if you're done why are you if you speak up too much oh you're taking all the attention on you and I I love that fact because people always who accuse people of being the center of attention they
(05:51) are actually not very happy that the attention is not from them this is actually like a rule on social media but yeah there was a backlash but there's also a backlash from the other side which um I I mean here and other comedy clubs I worked with people from all kind of different backgrounds Jewish Christians Muslims Arabs atheists all kinds of people and there are a lot of people who went to to my social like oh s a terrorist sympathizer now you know and uh I think it is important to have uh a nuanced deep interesting intelligent
(06:24) conversation a lot of people waiting for this are kind yeah B very Pierce show him and this is the problem with the news today the problem the news today it's not about the news anymore it's about the people giving you the news so it becomes a show a circus two Gladiators in the Coliseum two pigs fighting the mud and this is why people don't get anything out of it it's a circus you know one of the things I heard a lot was who is this guy and they weren't talking about me sometimes sometimes I wonder
(07:00) obviously you're very very well known in the Arab world you're known as the kind of they called you the Arab John Stewart and you're well known in America but you weren't that well known for example in the UK uh and I think what this interview did it made a lot of people think wow all right this this is incredible but tell me more about basam MF and I I did a bit of research into your life and is a fascinating Journey that you've gone on to get here to Los Angeles and I think it's worth just
(07:25) taking a little beat here to talk about this because you began in Cairo as a heart surgeon I me that was your career path yes and and you were a heart surgeon I was a heart surgeon until yeah uh I spent 19 years in that car 7 years in medical school 12 years as a practicing doctor and uh 2011 happened and the revolution happened and I had my own show on YouTube I did like small videos well I'm going to come to this because I was in I by coincidence I just joined CNN to replace the great Larry King and I hadn't actually done any live
(07:58) show I'd done a few weeks since I joined of taped interviews with big names Donald Trump Oprah Winfrey things like that and I was flying back to Los Angeles when I got a message that Egypt was going up in start of the Arab Spring and I actually went to a studio very near here about a mile down the road on Sunset the CNN studio the old Larry King studio and I went live for the first time and it was about the Arab Spring it was about what was happening in Egypt and at the same time you in Egypt were actually in teror square helping wounded
(08:33) protesters actually medically treating them yeah yeah uh I mean this was a kind of movement that inspired a lot of Egyptians um at the time I was you know I was in the hospital and a lot of people just volunteered and the nurses was just like giving us like supplies go go go and we were going there and we were basically tending to the wounded because it is and and it kind of gives you a different perspective when you see helpless defenseless people who do who are not armed who are being beaten by Security Forces military forces being
(09:10) shot being uh you know hurt and uh all we can do is just like provide some medical attention and it kind of gives you a perspective to see how Humanity sometimes can show its most ugly faed and the suppression of free speech freedom of expression yeah the ability of people to say what they honestly feel about a situation and the suppression of people's basic rights to Freedom absolutely yeah and uh that kind of like taught me a lot and uh and ins smir me to do the show but you know well you start it's a crazy story this and I I
(09:45) want to tell it because you just decide to do five minute stuff on YouTube yeah and you are expecting a few people to watch it and then literally it just flies and suddenly you're getting millions of people what watching this and very quickly one of the big networks comes in and then you're suddenly doing this stuff for 30 to 40 million people like a third of the entire population of Egypt is tuning in to watch it you're the biggest star of Egyptian television oh please you are don't stop sobody I mean what an extraordinary
(10:18) thing though for a heart surgeon yeah to go from helping protesters medically into Ria Square the start of the Arab Spring to within a year you're the biggest star on Egyptian television it's a crazy thing it it doesn't sound as glamorous as this it's it feels it it felt horrible did it why oh yeah overnight Fame this size it's toxic terrible terrible it it it's it corrupts it it it it goes into your soul and it's not good it's not I I I actually didn't enjoy it uh and the worst the worst part
(10:52) about is that like you're trying to do comedy in very controversial Climate about very controversial issues so you'll never never satisfied people and the problem is that you're people have these expectations oh if you are successful in this you must be successful at solving this and when things are not solved because Politics as you know very difficult to solve uh the the that expectation this love turns into hate and and and this is and this is one of many many reasons that I had to leave and I and I came here eventually well
(11:23) let's just take people through what happened because they probably don't know a lot of people so during the presidency of Muhammad who was a democratically elected islamist you you had relative freedom to start but then the more you went after government propaganda the more you stood up for the people against the government then the trouble started Mory wanted to shut you up you eventually get dragged through the courts I was arrested I was arrested for one day it was a warrant for my arrest and then I turned myself
(11:52) in and I was interrogated and it was the funniest interrogation ever and in my stand-up shows I I I talk about that scene cuz the guards were reading the stuff out and laughing right well the guards were taking selfies with me which is funny and and the uh and and it the exchange between me and the inter and persecutor general persecutor was extremely funny I mean I don't like to victimize myself I just like oh look at I actually like to find humor but why were you arrested what was the criteria oh yeah the I I think the list was
(12:24) insulting Islam insulting the president spreading false rumors and disrupting the fabric of society and uh and it was I think the people in the room didn't know what to do with me because they ended up discussing my jokes so it turned into a writer's room and I I was kind of like how do you think we make this funnier and it was the funniest exchange ever and after 6 hours I I was let go and uh was it scary though at the same time that suddenly the Machinery was getting a grip of you because it was to get a lot scarier but
(12:58) was it in that moment when when you first got arrested you thought I'm being arrested for breaching my freedom of speech right for some reason I I I just like went with the flow I went to the interrogation wearing the big hat I went to the show it was it was just I I just wanted this to be a force because I I just like you you're really coming after the comedian and it it was it I I I just tried to enjoy myself but deep inside I was dying well you actually it it gets serious enough where you may have died
(13:32) because actually Mory gets of course deposed in comes a general LCC in a coup a military coup and he doesn't find satar a laughing matter particularly when the jokes are about him you get blocked they literally block your show from airing I aired one episode and it's interesting this is this is a very interesting story because the first episode that was aired after after the removal in the Muslim Brotherhood everybody was waiting to see what I will say because by that time all of the Islamic channels that were me like me
(14:07) and me and Islamic CH like it's like they had five channels and they were like me and them going like that they they had like five channels I have only one hour a week and then they were removed and then a lot of the other desent voices were also being shut down now I people are waiting what will bessim say and on the day that the show aired the next day I went I went out and everybody's like good good at least somebody is speaking it was a very controversial episode nobody liked it and yet everybody liked it because
(14:34) people said like you're supporting the coup no you're the Muslim Brotherhood everybody accused me of something all I did in that episode was just being a mirror of what is happening in the street and showing them how ridiculous it is you didn't take your fixed position well my position depending on where what's your position what did you intend your position my my position was to show the Ridiculousness of how the people now was like oh we got rid of Islamic fascism but we are heading towards another fascism H there
(15:06) was and there was a song that I did that was very controversial people it's very funny the the pr Muslim Brotherhood thought that this is a disrespect to the people who died and on the other side the people said that this is a disrespect to the Army and when you manage to offend everybody you know you're right yes and then the people in the midd is like oh you weren't you weren't tough enough and I was told I like why didn't you go after the the the the the the ceiling of Freedom just went
(15:32) down and I was just like it was very diff it is very difficult to go against an an authority that is very that was very popular at the time and especially a military Authority with a lot lot of experience oh yeah of weaponizing these situations yeah you had death threats people would always choose most of the time they always choose the military form rather than the religious form because they they kind of like uh at this they are not infringing on my personal freedom not yet but uh you had threats on your life didn't you
(16:04) oh all the time I don't talk about that because like I have been having death threats like did never stopped since 2011 never stopped have they continued since our last interview oh yeah they never stopped people threatening to kill you all the time why for what reason oh for just saying something that they don't like oh because you you are against Egypt you're against Islam you're against our president you're against God it it never stop it never stops it doesn't doesn't bother you I mean if you die you die you know
(16:35) if you die you die I mean since since when whatever like no bodyguards deflected a bullet you know maybe the guy who with ronal dragan but I I I I I I think it's like whatever even like at a certain point I actually had like private security and then I told him I can't I I cannot live like that if if that's my destiny if I die I [Applause]
(17:49) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
(19:17) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you end up with your lawyer said you got to get out of here you got to get out of Egypt it's getting too dangerous yeah
(20:20) something bad's going to happen you're going to get arrested again and probably Su in jail or you're going to going to try and kill you and you flee to Dubai mhm and then you end up here in America yes was that always the plan to eventually come to America or was it expediency because of what happened well it's funny that you said that because I visited the United States after the first year of my show and uh um a doctor that's there Egyptian doctor has been there for for a while I said listen
(20:47) bessim you you are very visible in the media and I think you can use that to apply for a green card as a special talent and I did and I said like I I I have like a huge show criteria because I have the same is uh an alien of exceptional ability is what they call you charmingly yes we're very exceptionally able aliens we are but we are still aliens yeah yeah I know it always makes me laugh you can come here but you are an alien alien but you're exceptional and uh I um I just applied for it and I got it I got the time 100
(21:20) that help both from my uh my application and said ah maybe I'm not going to use it and then when that happens oh the green card came handy so a lot of people think that I'm heing Asylum I'm not I just it was just a strike of luck you now do stand up and you done it for 5 years and fascinating that you do some of it for an Arab audience have an whole in Arabic and and an English speaking version and they probably very different right because different sensibilities different humor different crowds
(21:49) different expectation M yes well will the Arab audience come to my show they expect that it's going to be another version of my show that I did in Egypt and I said no it's a my personal story even then this weekend right before I met you because of our interview I sold out Arizona really yes and I and I and I stood and the first thing I said like who here came because over the PS Morgan show I was like like I was like boy you're going to be disappointed because this is not about that but isn't that
(22:17) amazing I mean that shows the power of that interview resident even in in Arizona here yeah because I don't want I don't want to be I don't want to succeed just because of a trending moment of time it is the sh same show that I've been working and perfecting and like any standup comedian in the United States your dream is what is to sell you special to platforms like NEX HBO and you want to get there because for me that was like a like a re like a rebirth because I thought like everything was
(22:45) lost I came here I had nothing first three four years it was ter the first two years I was doing standup oh I bombed hard I bummed hard and I I went home crying I said I'm not going to make it and then suddenly I have already a tour I mean even before our show I already had a set tour and now I'm having like this ability of like talking to people with different languages talking to all these different language the show that I did in Arizona had an incredible mix of Arabs and Americans and they came here and they
(23:13) completely and there a lot of them came they were Palestinians and they came with like the Palestinian flags and the CA and they thought it's like guys it's like the way laughter being good at your job in is in in its way a a way of resistance before we can I can I can I show okay so this is a gift from me and my wife this is uh olive oil from the West Bank ah whenever you go to I go to Jordan a lot but my wife also like ask for the oil from the West Bank it's very good it is the best oil ever and the
(23:49) thing is olive trees they they know they survive up to 600 years M and they are passed from one generation to the other and uh it is like a family heritage and the way that you do it so this is zat zat is basically Thyme and you add to it Sesame and a bunch of herbs and the way that you eat that you take like a piece of bread we don't have to do it now maybe at the end of the interview the end and you basically you soak it a little bit in the oil and then you take the Z and I'll demonstrate here and then and then here
(24:31) I love it well I love Arabic food so at the end of the interview you living with this o I will take that it's your well thank you and it's very kind of your wife thank you thank you very much for me well I'm done tooted but it's okay obviously you started the last interview with I mean I would argue savagely dark humor involving your wife how you've been trying to kill her and she was using your kids as human Shields and stuff and I I'll be honest with you I'm still trying to but I but you know
(24:56) what when I failed you know what I did M I went out to the house and I just like randomly slapped other neighbors you know it's interesting by mistake now this time I'm ready for you okay this time I'm ready for the humor oh you're ready okay no but it's interesting because last time I was very taken aback and I remember thinking as you were doing this at right off the top I remember feeling very uncomfortable unusually uncomfortable and thinking I didn't know how to react to that I didn't know whether I was supposed to
(25:20) laugh or be silent or and I sort of ended up sort of slightly grimacing half laugh and listening and then I realized it was very powerful what you were doing it was satirical but it was savagely satirical and extremely effective and that's why I think the interview did so well you know why because all I did was just take the talking points that's been in the media not just for after October 7th all through the conflict it's always like we need to kill it all right you need to kill five no kill 10 you need to
(25:54) kill some no kill all this is what satire does he takes it take take reality flipped on his head exaggerate and then you can see how sometimes very uncomfortable and even sometimes stupid that sounds because I was just reacting to whatever the media is telling me it's like oh yeah okay good do it govern there's no push back so suddenly the person who's proposing The Most Extreme Measures like oh take oh that's too much so that that was like a very simple technique I just talk took the talk point and just
(26:28) exaggerated it was it was devastatingly effective I think um first before we go any further how is your wife's family because she is a Palestinian yeah are they okay are they they're good they're good they are safe for now yeah um in as like that last week there was no internet as you have yes you know I saw you tweet at the IDF it's like how can they know you know how many views that tweets at nearly 40 million yeah me just saying how are they going to see this message if you've cut the internet off
(26:57) I'm I'm wondering if the IDF like why aren't the Palestinians liking my tweet because they don't see it right no but I thought that was a perfectly correct assessment of it yeah um but the reaction to that tweet I did was enormous as everything is in this in this thing I had a lot of people say finally appears you get it right finally you get it and and I wanted to say listen I'm I'm trying to reach a place where I get this but it's an incredibly complicated issue for someone who is not
(27:26) Arabic or Jewish to poke their head into and I've had to cover it as a journalist for a long long time I think I said to you before that I was elit of a Daily Mirror in England when we opposed the Iraq War for example so you know I have taken stands on this thing on this one I find and I'm going to be completely straight with you I discussed this with Jordan Peterson um this week and he did a pretty incur tweet in which he said give him hell Netanyahu enough is enough and he was actually very self-reflective
(27:54) about that in the interview we did this week where he later issued issued a 20 minute video because he said sometimes a a oneline tweet can be unnecessarily inflammatory to people much better to take time to explain it here's here's where I've got to with this conflict now I viewed what happened on October the 7th as an absolutely appalling atrocity a terror attack of unimaginable horror and I absolutely think that Israel has a right to defend itself from the people who committed it and mass and
(28:29) I've questioned for the last 3 4 weeks what is a proportionate response and I have said repeatedly I don't know the answer I want people who have a view to have a view about that and I'll ask you again about where you think we are with this I also acknowledge that Hamas live among civilian population in Gaza and therefore if you do what the Israelis are currently doing which is a ground offensive into Gaza a lot of civilians are going to get killed and at what point does that become dis disproportionate or even
(29:00) illegal and I don't know the answers to those questions and I have a moral quandry because my instinct is to say that Israel has no choice but to respond to what happened in a very forceful manner I understand why they want to eliminate Hamas Al together I understand that if they feel they can then perhaps we can move to a a two-state solution or peace or whatever it may be although I don't think that yahu will ever be the person to do that but the the moral question for me is at what point does this become disproportionate and when
(29:34) you see thousands of children being killed in Gaza it fills me with utter horror and then people say well do you condemn it and I find it very easy to condemn Israel turning off the water Israel turning off the power I think it's terrible what's happening in the West Bank with the settlers I think that the stuff there is completely easy to condemn but can I hand on heart condemn Israel trying to destroy Hamas after what they did on October the 7th that is where I'm struggling to find myself saying I condemn it because I believe
(30:12) that they are right to try and Destroy Hamas now what do you feel about my moral quandry well there is there's a lot of points very lot and I think this is this was kind of like uh Le the ground rules for that uh interview there is the whole thing about like is right to defend itself the condemnation first of all let's start with condemnation yes you want my opinion yes condemning Hamas or condemning Israel yes completely useless completely useless why you I condemn Hamas you condemn Israel interview is
(30:40) over what happened nothing it is just checkpoint like morality checkpoints but I've interviewed a lot of pro Palestinians for example some of whom will immediately say I unreservedly condemn the terror attacks of October the 7th and then go on to criticize is and I think that's a very a position I can completely respect but I find it much harder to respect a pro Palestinian guest on my show if they simply resolutely refuse to say that they can condemn the terror attacks I find that less worthy of respect but you see this
(31:16) is the problem with the news we go into the circular motion of the same as one thing that I have noticed not just on the coverage of these events the the the events before and 4 and four every time this starts people say we don't know what's happening it's a very complicated situation what is happening now and for me as a viewer if a conflict has been there for 75 years and the media with all this technology has been covering it and we hear the same exact words we don't know what's happening it's
(31:46) complicated it's a very complex that is a failure of the media apparatus that is the failure to themselves and for the audience because why every time this happens it seems like it is happening from from from from point zero and I think to help understand that I will get to October 7th I will get to the condemnation I will get to the selfdefense but I think maybe we can do we we have like all the time in the world and we can discuss this could this interview could be a bookmark Landmark for maybe looking at that conflict in a
(32:22) deeper way that nobody had gone there before we have the views we have people waiting you know as a said I'm the least qualified to discuss that but it's an opportunity to use listen I'm not massively well qualified myself yeah both of us like an Irish Catholic I mean look at us two privileged people one white one one white white wannabe discussing discussing the the most complex conflict of of our of our history but we're here good morning everybody hope you're well thanks for joining us you're

(34:10) worried about so are you saying that you're being overwhelmed that you're inundated we are really working hard for you and we're just asking patients to be patient with us are we only going to be trusting sources like meta and Google and Facebook and X form you known as Twitter where is our where is our unbiased news going to come from Welcome to the talk it's really great to be back my Little Darlings kids think all they have to do is stay at home be silly take pictures of everything just shut down

(35:16) man you know what I'm saying just cuz they're skin folk don't mean they're kin folk when I say I am God you think I'm joking or not you tell me I'm not joking I'd rather do it on camera no no no know if it's on camera we're not doing an interview why we'll explain why how do you feel about that influence that you had you better be careful we're coming for your children there buddy about Maring Nation yes I'm going to do you're going to resign I'm going I've been
(35:41) answering your question you answer mine it's actually not my job to answer your questions thank God for talk TV is not only the home of common sense it's the only place where you get the [Music] truth this is to York TV I've never met anyone like him and I don't think I ever will again you only consumated your relationship on your wedding night that's right did you feel Elvis was a controlling influence on you controlling his death was something that shook the entire world devastating my big fear was Lisa she was only nine at
(36:19) the time Lisa of course at one stage was married briefly to Michael Jackson were you concerned mhm very the Elvis movie was being fated at the Golden Globes within 48 hours and she incredibly sadly died that hug was the last hug I gave her I was just wondering actually genuinely how you were doing it has been pretty tough you know I lost my mom then I lost my grandson then I lost my daughter I don't know exactly how to answer that don't talk anymore that can you stop the camera please [Music] I want to start in a totally different
(37:07) area I want to start with anti-Semitism yes I think it's an important issue yes I think there is a rise of anti-em semitism in the world and I think there is uh this is very dangerous and I as a Muslim who has been through events where there were terrorist attacks somewhere and that reflects to us on us I I completely completely feel that uh and I think it is very important to agree on the language because the word anti-semite has been used and abused and most most of the time not on for the you know for the good in um interest of the
(37:52) Jewish people because the first two days of the coverage I watched the news and I and there was a lot of um protest that was led by Jewish voice for peace and they were read by people who opposed the Israeli attack on the civilians and I remember quite well many of the Republican representatives in Congress came out and they were calling these the global intifada the global Jihad I love it when they say Jihad they sound like a horse Jihad it's very funny and or they they say like these are and I quote Iranian backed jihadists and I said wait
(38:33) a minute but most of those people are Jewish those people who took over the capital the same people who took over Central Station in New York which is known as the biggest Civil Disobedience event in America in the last two decades they were all Jewish and then I find Niki Haley saying anti-zionism equals anti-Semitism and then I find Nikki haly saying anti-zionism equals anti-semitism and then I remember it's like oh Jewish people in America are saddled by the fact that they are not citizens of America or citizens of the world but
(39:06) they are citizens of Israel and they have to back Israel in whatever they do and these are not my words these are the words of John Stewart he went out and he said I said like and he said it's is very very important to divide these two and what is very very interesting would you compare that on that specific point to the way that people try and say all Palestinians are responsible and accountable for what Hamas do yes in other words I think you can be very critical of Israeli government and their policies and Benjamin Netanyahu and the
(39:38) politicians but that doesn't mean that you have to take that criticism to innocent Israelis who may have exactly the same criticism themselves and this is why it is very important to have these kind of discussions because it the funnest not the funniest the saddest thing that I saw is the people that were in so so much support of Israel are anti-semite themselves MTG MTG MTG uh Mer Taylor green you know she said like oh those are I send my AIDS and they took pictures of the protesters basically she's surveilling protesters
(40:14) and Mery Taylor green is very known for a very famous Post in 2018 where she blamed the California wildfire fires on a Jewish space laser gun do you remember that do you remember that I just like oh they were bur because Jewish investors Rothchild and finin anything with that ends with Stein because that's of course sounds of Jewish they put a satellite and shooting laser beams to and and and not just her you have Steve skolis SK thank you so much he is the now the the speaker of the house and he has been invited before in a in a for
(40:57) an organization that was funded by David Duke the founder of the KKK you have Kevin McCarthy who is the former minority speaker leader of of Republican party in the house and he accused Jewish billionaires of rigging the midterm so how come those people are accusing us of anti-semite so here's the thing so go let's go to the equation that Niki Haley put on Twitter anti-zionism equals anti-Semitism no it is true people who hate Jews they also anti it is true and you could be someone who hate Zionist who don't like Zionist and you are
(41:31) Semite you could even be Jewish and guess what you could be a Zionist like those people uh supporting Israel and at the same time you hate the Jews because the chat Jews will not replace us these echoed in Charlottesville it did not echo in Gaza I mean in Gaza they say War stuff in in between the bombing under down time but and these are the same people who are seen with Nick Fuentes with uh with with Steven B and you know what's had him for dinner Mar and all of those people are buddies with Benjamin Netanyahu so how does this work how does
(42:06) this work and you know the people who speak against this like John Stewart Like Bernie Sanders like uh Naomi Klein what do they call these people what do they call them self-hating Jews and know what else now now they call them they call them capus capus you know what's capus capus basically these were the Jewish inmate in osit that were forced by the Nazis to stand as guards on their own inmates you see how degrading this is and this is the way to shut down conversation anti-semite islamophobe you hate America
(42:39) you hate the military you hate Egypt war on Christmas this is how you should an environment that does not allow disagreement is not an environment made for it's an envirment for control let me ask you this on say the student protests in America universities I have no problem instinctively with students protesting is actually part of the DNA of being a student right but I do have a problem with two things one the protest that happened almost immediately after October the 7th within hours which were clearly deeply deliberately inflamatory
(43:13) and hurtful to Jewish people secondly I have a real problem with the students who were beaming direct pramas slogans onto buildings on campuses in America you know I'm for free speech and I really am the whole show is predicated from that but not to the point where you see Jewish students barricaded into libraries because a mob is descending on them there is a distinction to me between people who are obviously overtly I mean there was a professor at Cornell University who was literally seen in public shouting how
(43:46) exhilarated he felt by the attacks of October the 7th he still hasn't been fired that guy I think that crosses a line do you yeah I do not like this way I mean I can understand why but I don't condone it I would never because you have to understand these people again I'm not supporting them I just want to make sure about two things the reason that I started with anti-Semitism because I wanted to make sure to clear any confusion that when I speak about Israel I'm speaking about Israel yes when I speaking about Jewish people I'm
(44:14) speaking about Jewish people yes when I speaking speak it's very because no I think it was very powerful that he did that yeah I have that's the first thing you did because I think it's really important yeah but at the same time when I tell you why does that happen it doesn't mean that I condone it there's a difference between explanation and justification those people who are exhilarated the way that they this is the the same uh reason why people were so happy about the interview what do
(44:43) they see they see Israel as a criminal State who is killing their people and in the same time they are supported by the International Community America they have no guns they have no superpower backing them all they have is just feeling of Happiness like yes our enemies that we cannot touch them has been hurt all they can think about that these are their enemies that have been hurt right I'm not condoning this but again like when people were uh celebrating terrorist attacks you know against Western uh Western targets of
(45:16) course I don't condone that but why because those people has been from from a very young age what have they seen they're not being heard by the media the The Plight and the suffering of their Brothers in is in in Palestine in the Arab world are not being here people in Iraq you know like when when America and Britain invaded Iraq right what what the Arabs so it's like two superpowers are coming in on on just regular people so whenever there was like a bomb or like an attack on American troops people
(45:43) would celebrate yeah they our enemies emotions are very inflammatory and it is not right but those people had nothing else all they just like shout all they say is like to to to to rejoice it is not right again I'm explaining why is this happening because it's like yeah if I cannot get you I'm just going to scratch your eyes I'm going to scratch your eyes because because you've been beating me all the time and you have the whole International Community backing you up and all I can do is Scream is it
(46:14) right no but it is understandable again not the right thing but I it's not like understandable it's like oh I no but again it is an explanation [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
(47:39) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
(48:57) [Music] [Music] [Music] what does the Western audience see they see people rejoicing for the death of innocent civilians in Israel this is what have the Arabs seen for years in in on the Arab board for example if you look up sidro cinema this is in 2014 when when Israel was bombing Gaza as usual and the
(50:04) Israelis in the sidro uh uh Kuts or the the settlement they were s they went on a hill and they had popcorn and they had drinks and they were like watching the show and they were cheering with every rocket coming down this is what we see Western people didn't see that well somebody found a tweet actually of mine from 2014 in which I said at what point does what Israel is currently doing to the Palestinian people become terrorism and because I've always said you know I've spoken about this a lot over the
(50:33) years and I've always try to be extremely fair-minded orbe it nobody really wants you to be fair- minded they want you to take a side but that was clear that my thinking back then was that they were absolutely overstepping absolutely absolutely but I'm again to the point of rejoicing no I know what you mean but like if you for example Google Google the wedding of hate this is like a Jewish wedding in Israel where they were celeb ating the ARs and Palestinian to be clear I've seen lots of video but I'm not talking to you
(51:01) pierce I'm talking to the Western audience because because I want to see like I want to say like this is what they see I mean for example there is a very famous video for Sam abuan who is like a young kid that he was shot Point Black by an Israeli soldier and he was not allowed to have any medical attention and as his dead body was being put into the Abul ambulance the Jewish settlers were cheering so for an Arab audience this is what we see every day so when they see oh we heard them back we heard their people like their heard
(51:34) back it is not right but this is what hates does it escalates it feeds each other radicalism feeds it it is terrible and it is a it is just like a vicious circle so I would like to do something that is very interesting tonight I want when I invited John Stewart to my show as much of like a reception that you if if you see on the YouTube people just like we had to cut the 5 minute standing ovation for broadcast people was on their feet for 5 minutes they could not believe it I remember John telling me I could never imagine that a Jewish guy
(52:08) from New Jersey would have that kind of reception in K and yet on the internet people who would what you brought a Jew on your show why you are with a Jew yes hate is there and I want to do something very interesting today I want to give I I I'm I'm I like telling stories and I'm going to tell you a very nice story this is the story surprise surprise of the suffering and the plight of the Jewish people and I want to say that because it is very inter when you see the trauma and the suffering that the people
(52:44) on the other side went through you might understand why why they coming so so this is see this mhm this is a map of all of the history of the expulsion of the Jews in Europe they've been like I have not never seen a minority being kicked around this much right and of course this comes back to the you know the whole idea about the original sin that you have uh betrayed the uh Jesus Christ the the the the the the blood of Jesus is on your head and then comes the 11th century at that time Jewish people were
(53:22) not allowed to own land they were just peasants even some of the professions are not even allowed to participate in but they were allowed to do one thing usually money lending because it was prohibited by the Catholic Church to engage into that so what happens when you work in money you get richer right and those Jews lefted in ghettos now ghettos was not just like isolated neighborhoods in cities sometimes ghettos were outside the city this is like how isolated they were and in those GTO they have to pay gold to the mayor
(53:54) or the governor or the prince or the noble so they would see you're getting richer I need more taxes so they pay tax what happens when you have a business and they increase your rent you increase your service increase the tax so what happened what the Christians started to default and suddenly the image of the greedy Jew was created Merchant of Venice this was the kind of Oppression that the Jewish people went through fast forward 19th century there was like the Eastern Jew in Ukraine and and Russia and there was the Western
(54:25) Jews in Europe those people in the East the easn Jews had to immigrate because they were pgms and they were like you know kicked out and that and a certain point the people in the west especially in England it's like there are too many Jews we need a solution a solution for what for the Jewish problem so it's like we need to get rid of them and you know what Palestine was not even on the in the a list Palestine was in the b list because England proposed 6,000 square miles in Uganda for the Jews 1903 and the reason why Palestine was not on
(54:58) the list that it was objected by a lot of rabbis that said like it's a Promised Land but only when the Messiah comes but there were other options Argentina South Africa Uganda Madagascar and eventually they said all right let's do Palestine so they went to Palestine 1914 there was 700,000 people living in Palestine 3% were Jewish 1917 Bel for declaration Arthur Belfor he called the Jewish people in England that they are alien and hos child race and the thing is the only Jewish member of the parliament of the English Parliament
(55:30) Lord mono he objects like these are British citizens they we should not kick them out so they pushed them they pushed them but it was not going fast enough came the Nazis and then it was not about the solution anymore it was the end losing the Final Solution by Hitler because he needed an answer for the Jewish question the you and then the as you see the Holocaust happened the most orchestrated in mized horrible genocide in our modern time 6 million Jews di so it accelerated and they went the first of all they left
(56:04) Eastern Europe and they went to West Europe and went to America and they were turned down and they were pushed towards Palestine so by 1948 right before the Declaration of the state of Israel there were 2 million people living there only 30% of them was Jews so the whole idea of like a land without a people to a people without a land it was a marketing thing they were already Palestinians so suddenly overnight 1948 there were one 1.
(56:28) 5 million Palestinians seven half of them three4 of them were overnight pushed into refugees and this is why it's called the neba the catastrophe so now we have all of this building up into the minds and that and suddenly this was like a conflict a hate a problem that we didn't have to do anything with this was basically pushed on us by the Europeans you see so this is why it is important to say that and I'm not saying that just like oh let's Wipe Out the state of Israel let's like push up in the sea no but it's important when you talk about
(56:58) the conflict that you talk about the root causes right no there were there was like a vibrant Palestinian culture happening over there and right now they are erasing this culture suddenly I'm seeing of like Israeli feta cheese Israeli homus oh that's an insult Israeli homus come on I mean take the land but leave the homos man I mean come on I mean that's that's not fair you are someone who's always spoken against culture cancel culture right now a whole culture is cancel [Music] we're here good morning everybody hope```
