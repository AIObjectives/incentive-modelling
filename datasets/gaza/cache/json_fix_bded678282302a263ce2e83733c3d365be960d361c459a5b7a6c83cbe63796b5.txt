You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON.

I'm sorry, but this document doesn't contain relevant information about Hamas to answer your questions. As a result, I'm unable to fulfil your request.

=== RESULTS ===

{
  "message": "I'm sorry, but this document doesn't contain relevant information about Hamas to answer your questions. As a result, I'm unable to fulfil your request."
