You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:


{
   "stated_goals": [],
   "main_motivations": [],
   "possible_actions": [],
   "good_scenarios": [],
   "bad_scenarios": [],
   "main_fears": [],
   "resources": [],
}


=== RESULTS ===

The given string is almost a valid JSON string. JSON object cannot end with a comma. So, just removing the last comma will make it valid. It should look like this:

```json
{
   "stated_goals": [],
   "main_motivations": [],
   "possible_actions": [],
   "good_scenarios": [],
   "bad_scenarios": [],
   "main_fears": [],
   "resources": []
}
```
