You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [
    {
      "item": "Open a second front with Israel",
      "quote": "One is that if Israel invades Gaza, it is feared that that will then open up a second front with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that dominates Southern Lebanon, which is allied to Hamas."
    }
  ],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [
    {
      "item": "Being attacked during an Israel invasion of Gaza",
      "quote": "Then there’s the fact that Hamas is very well dug in underneath its stronghold of Gaza City. It has hundreds of miles of tunnels that it’s burrowed away over the last decade and a half. And it’s very hard to get to them there, and it’s very easy for their fighters to pop up through openings in the ground and ambush the incoming Israeli army."
    }
  ],
  "main_fears": [
    {
      "item": "Being attacked during an Israel invasion of Gaza",
      "quote": "Then there’s the fact that Hamas is very well dug in underneath its stronghold of Gaza City. It has hundreds of miles of tunnels that it’s burrowed away over the last decade and a half. And it’s very hard to get to them there, and it’s very easy for their fighters to pop up through openings in the ground and ambush the incoming Israeli army."
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "item": "Network of subterrean fortifications in Gaza",
      "quote": "Then there’s the fact that Hamas is very well dug in underneath its stronghold of Gaza City. It has hundreds of miles of tunnels that it’s burrowed away over the last decade and a half. And it’s very hard to get to them there, and it’s very easy for their fighters to pop up through openings in the ground and ambush the incoming Israeli army."
    }, 
    {
      "item": "Alliance with Hamas ",
      "quote": "One is that if Israel invades Gaza, it is feared that that will then open up a second front with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that dominates Southern Lebanon, which is allied to Hamas."
    }
  ], 
}

=== RESULTS ===

Here's the string you requested with the necessary fixes:

```
{
  "stated_goals": [],
  "main_motivations": [],

    }

    }
  ]
}

I've removed the trailing comma after the last key-value pair in the "resources" array to make the JSON syntactically valid.
