You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

The provided document does not contain enough specific information to accurately answer the questions about Hamas' stated goals, motivations, possible actions, good scenarios, bad scenarios, main fears, or resources. The document appears to focus more on general geopolitics and the personal interests of Congress members, rather than providing detailed information on Hamas and its objectives or activities.

=== RESULTS ===

This paragraph is not a JSON file itself. But here's how you could represent this text as a JSON:

{
  "documentReview": {
    "contentSpecificity": "not enough",
    "contentFocus": [
      "Hamas's stated goals",
      "motivations",
      "possible actions",
      "good scenarios",
      "bad scenarios",
      "main fears",
      "resources"
    ],
    "review": "The document appears to focus more on general geopolitics and the personal interests of Congress members, rather than providing detailed information on Hamas and its objectives or activities."
  }
}
