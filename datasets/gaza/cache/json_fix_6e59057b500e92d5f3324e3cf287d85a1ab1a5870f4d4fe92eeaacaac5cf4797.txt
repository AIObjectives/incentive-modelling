You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [
    {
      "item": "Support for Israel's security",
      "quote": "(02:00) let's have a look at Joe Biden as you might imagine pledging support and claiming that this is a simple moral issue my Administration and support for Israel's security is Rock Solid and unwavering."
    }
  ], 
  "main_motivations": [], 
  "possible_actions": [
    {
      "item": "Policy decisions regarding military expenditure",
      "quote": "(06:50) how can you have people involved in making decisions about American Military expenditure similarly investing in companies that will benefit from American Military expenditure"
    }
  ], 
  "good_scenarios": [], 
  "bad_scenarios": [
    {
      "item": "Scenario of conflict exploitation with personal profit",
      "quote": "(05:01) military relation stocks let's have a look at Joe Biden as you might imagine pledging support and claiming that this is a simple moral issue. How does that look in light of the fact that members of Congress have been investing in military relation"
    }
  ], 
  "main_fears": [], 
  "resources": [
    {
      "item": "Authority to make decisions affecting military aspects of conflicts",
      "quote": "(02:34) to be reduced to an exercise in profiteering particularly not by people that are making decisions with regard to the military aspect of this encounter"
    }
  ], 
}

=== RESULTS ===

The string is almost a proper JSON string, but the only problem is the trailing comma ',' at the end before the closing bracket '}'. Removing the trailing comma should fix the JSON.

Here's the fixed string:

{
  "stated_goals": [
    {
      "item": "Support for Israel's security",
      "quote": "(02:00) let's have a look at Joe Biden as you might imagine pledging support and claiming that this is a simple moral issue my Administration and support for Israel's security is Rock Solid and unwavering."
    }
  ], 
  "main_motivations": [],

      "item": "Policy decisions regarding military expenditure",
      "quote": "(06:50) how can you have people involved in making decisions about American Military expenditure similarly investing in companies that will benefit from American Military expenditure"
    }

  "good_scenarios": [], 
  "bad_scenarios": [

    }
  ]
