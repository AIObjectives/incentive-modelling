You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON.

=== RESULTS ===

{
  "message": "I'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be any specific information related to Ben Shapiro in the document provided. Therefore, your questions cannot be answered based on the document's content."
