You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

The document provided does not provide any specific information on Fallujah regarding the questions mentioned. It discusses the situation between Israel and Gaza but does not mention concrete details about Fallujah's goals, motivations, actions, scenarios, fears, or resources.

Therefore, there's no information which can be extracted to provide a list of concise answers with exact quotes from the document for the city of Fallujah in Iraq. 

{

"stated_goals": [],

"main_motivations": [],

"possible_actions": [],

"good_scenarios": [],

"bad_scenarios": [],

"main_fears": [],

"resources": [],

}

Here's the fixed JSON:

  "main_motivations": [],
  "possible_actions": [],
  "good_scenarios": [],
  "bad_scenarios": [],
