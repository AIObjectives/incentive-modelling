You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

The provided document does not contain specific information on Donald Trump. Therefore, it's impossible to provide any insights regarding his goals, motivations, actions, good scenarios, bad scenarios, fears, or resources from this specific document.

=== RESULTS ===

{
  "Message": "The provided document does not contain specific information on Donald Trump. Therefore, it's impossible to provide any insights regarding his goals, motivations, actions, good scenarios, bad scenarios, fears, or resources from this specific document."
