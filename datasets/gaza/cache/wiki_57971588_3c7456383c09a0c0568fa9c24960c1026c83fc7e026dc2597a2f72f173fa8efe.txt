 I have used the Wikipedia API to extract some description for a page but the description is a bit long: 

``` 
Page name: Jonathan Friedland
Long description: Professor Jonathan Samuel Friedland  is a British physician and medical researcher who is Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) and Professor of Infectious Diseases at St George's, University of London.
```

Return a more concise description. Aim for a single sentence, roughly 2 or 3 lines.
