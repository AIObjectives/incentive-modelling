Transcript:
(00:00) with tensions escalating in the war between Israel and Hamas surely no one will be cynical enough to exploit this situation in order to make a profit you wouldn't expect for example members of US Congress to be investing in military related stocks would you well you should expect that hello there you Awakening wonders thanks for joining us on our Voyage to truth and freedom at a time where is necessary more than ever to look at the world through different eyes and importantly support Independent Media where you can so we can have complex
(00:31) conversations about complex matters and review and analyze potential Solutions together certainly no one can claim to have answers with something as complicated as this but it's vital that you don't only believe what you read or see in Legacy Media with something so complex as this so if you can support us support us remember we're on Rumble every day download the app you get notifications and we can continue to stay in contact with you and learn from you and I pray to God develop Solutions together that are benefit beneficial for
(01:00) us individually collectively globally if such a thing were ever possible please make it revealed now obviously with something as sensitive as this you wouldn't imagine that there will be anyone anywhere in the world looking to exploit such a sensitive and awful situation from which nobody really clearly benefits if you ask me to be looking for opportunities to profit and yet that is precisely what's happening military experts are predicting record profits for weapons manufacturers as always happens in war and that's a
(01:29) brutal reality I suppose but you certainly wouldn't expect would you members of the United States Congress to be investing in defense related stocks wouldn't that undermine everything they've been telling you about the authenticity of their feelings however they regard this conflict or claim to regard this conflict all of the grand standing and moralizing and the sympathetic I stand with or we must be Pro how does that look in light of the fact that members of Congress have been investing in military relation
(02:00) stocks let's have a look at Joe Biden as you might imagine pledging support and claiming that this is a simple moral issue my Administration and support for Israel's security is Rock Solid and unwavering let me say this as clearly as I can not a high bar this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage or perhaps you could argue anyone to exploit these attacks from any angle surely with all of the complexity that must be considered in this long historic matter you wouldn't expect it
(02:34) to be reduced to an exercise in profiteering particularly not by people that are making decisions with regard to the military aspect of this encounter would you well you probably would if you have access to Independent Media because you will be well informed about the minations of government and in spite of its rhetoric what its priorities always remain will you ever believe again that they are morally guided let's get into this as tensions escalate between Israel and the hamus group it has been revealed
(03:03) us Congressional leaders have been making some Strategic investment moves into military related stocks that's pretty astonishing isn't it to consider that when most of us are thinking where do you find a unifying truth in this complex and horrific matter that there are people in Congress paid for by you elected to serve you that are right now going this might be a good time to invest in Lockheed Martin I think we're going to be selling a lot of missiles for starters defense company General Dynamics has witnessed a surge in
(03:33) purchases this isn't entirely unexpected defense stocks often become attractive during times of geopolitical tension and whilst that might be plain common sense it's also an indicator that there are systemic problems that might need to be addressed if foreign policy crises and Military crises are able to be exploited not just by the weapons industry which bad enough but also by politicians and Congress people that might be something that needs to be examined if Health crises are beneficial to pharmaceutical
(04:01) companies If energy crisis are beneficial to energy companies all the while punitive to Ordinary People All Around The World Isn't that an opportunity for systemic analysis Revolution reformation and change tell me which one in the chat and the comments however what's even more intriguing is the sectoral split between Republicans and Democrats a substantial number of Republicans have shown a keen interest in the energy sector heavyweights like Exon Mobile Devon energy and Chevron are clearly the fav on the other side of the aisle Democrats
(04:32) seem to be playing the long game focusing on the cyber security sector with Acquisitions in firms like 40 net according to insights by at unusual Wales on X there are so many complex issues it's cherish and rude I think to reduce this long historical painful agonizing conflict into platitudes or tribalism there are enough people that will do that perhaps we could focus together on the things that we can uniformly agree are wrong and I would say people in Congress buying stocks exploitative ly is wrong and could be
(05:01) banned but who would ever vote for such a thing who would ever propose such a legislation usually what happens at times like this is because there is a unified public opinion they push through a bill to invest more in defense and then maybe tack on an idea like and we'll also invest in more weapons for Ukraine as well that's also happening major defense stocks added around $20 billion in market cap yesterday following the events what's interesting about this is this is relatively mainstream media just reporting on this
(05:26) matter plainly observably makes you wonder why if we know all of this why are we not able to make different decisions together over the last 3 days on north of Grumman and led among those still trending higher these types of moves are not uncommon during times of War now a similar surge happened when Russia invaded Ukraine and you're looking at some of the movement that we're seeing today in LED Martin up just about 1% as well as Boeing RTX and Northrup also once again moving to the upside now these gains coming on like we
(05:56) just had a strong day for the stocks yesterday we we saw a big jump North coming off its biggest daily gain since we've seen uh that we've seen since 2020 the truth is if it's someone's job to make those kind of Investments I imagine they would make those kind of Investments but similarly true is if it's your job to run America to represent the people of America and you are also making those kind of Investments I would say that's a indication that your moral character is perhaps not appropriate for government
(06:25) but the thought process is just in terms of the amount of spending what's going to be allocated towards some of these defense companies given the conflict and the risk that this uh War could widen over in the Middle East that's why we're seeing the reaction play out in chairs today yeah and and from a technical perspective too it'd be interesting to look at this for anyone who's trying to figure out if some of the spikes that take place after there are international conflicts or or events of international
(06:50) conflict how can you have people involved in making decisions about American Military expenditure similarly investing in companies that will benefit from American Military expenditure that is one of the areas of corruption that I think we can all agree on ought be addressed it's the kind of bias that will lead to escalation in any conflict not even specifically this one because it remains profitable this has to be extracted this problem has to be closed down firstly and foremostly it should be illegal to trade in stocks and shares in
(07:23) industries that you regulate or in any matter in which you possibly have influence that's just common sent isn't it then perhaps it will be easier to have conversations around Solutions and peace complex though those conversations remain in the geopolitical climate that we're currently in whether that's the Russia Ukraine conflict or this current escalating situation in the Middle East how can we have a good faith open conversation at the level of media or the level of politics when plainly a
(07:51) significant factor is the opportunity to exploit these situations for Weaponry profit and energy profit wouldn't it be good to at least remove that so there was one less complex component that exacerbated this already Dreadful situation where some of the defensive names continue to cyclically in this instance here gets some type of attention from investors since and I kind of point back to early 2022 when we were thinking about the initiation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and what took place there shares jumped by
(08:23) about 25% in that instance it's held on since then to the majority of that move since beginning of 2022 remember these companies that see these benefits from these conflicts spend money on lobbying they spend billions collectively on lobbying lobbying simply means jostling cajoling biasing influencing prejudicing the direction of political expenditure taxpayer dollars will be flowing in this direction legislation regulation policy that prevents the continuation of that profit will be averred ignored reduced
(08:59) uced diluted you don't have to have strong views and many people understandably do on this complex horrific conflict to recognize that this is a problem this is a systemic problem and remember systemic problems are where we have to focus our attention if we actually want to change the world what institutionally is wrong with the media what institutionally is wrong with the government what I mean by institutionally is you could change the individuals within it you could even change the parties within it and the
(09:26) problem wouldn't change because the true power and the true interests are ulterior to the level that can be organized by public opinion or democracy or discourse or debate that's why you need Independent Media like this because complex and difficult though it is we must remain in communication with one another those of us that are not directly affected by the horrific events that are taking place have a different type of Duty a duty of respect a duty of care a duty I would say of deep spiritual prayer and deep hope but to
(09:56) remain importantly awakened awakened to the possibility that there surely must be a better way than this and that one of the ways that we might modulate in the favor of Peace might be to amend these systems let me know if you agree in the chat let me know if you agree in the comments and if you can press the red button become an awaken Wonder support our movement it's plain that this kind of conversation is a problem for the powerful they want people angry confused and divided and you have to look at the world now and say that fear
(10:24) and Terror and Dread and pain and confusion is increasing if we don't make any need measures to amend that as individuals as a community you can see where the trend is going to take us and then additionally here you think about uh the move hire that we've seen just over the past couple days here we can't bring you complex independent reporting without our sponsors and partners sat1 123.
(10:50) com make this thing let me tell you why this phone that looks a bit like it's from the recent past is actually the phone of the future are you suspicious of Technology are you addicted to that little thing do you think it's spying on you do you think it's tricking you can you rely on it cell phones go down for hundreds of reasons but satellite phones like this guy will always work because you're carrying your own personal sell Tower with you everywhere you go does that mean it's more hard to trace you prepare for the unexpected anyone with a
(11:16) satellite phone in the affected areas of Hawaii the Nevada desert like at Burning Man would have a way to communicate with friends and family and emergency services and guess what no tracking no one can listen in on your calls you can organize Revolution the most secure way to communicate is from a satellite phone to another satellite phone get one for your friends do walkie-talkies like kids like in the film big when they talk across the alley till Tom Hanks come a big person because of that machine it's
(11:42) got confusing already that Bloody film I still don't know what the messages the US military uses sa phones for secured communication and those guys know how to keep their business quiet please visit sat1 123.com or call 866 64360 n and use the promo code brand 50 to wave the $50 activation fee you don't need the old activation fee visit sat12 fre.
(12:08) com or you can call on your normal Spy Phone 866 6436 09 this service is only applicable I'm sorry to tell you if you're in the US which is a shame cuz I currently am not and I want one of these things okay let's get back to this difficult story about how we could make small changes that might make the world a little better and then communicate them so that people didn't know that's what we were planning the beginning of October shares up by about 10% Lockheed Martin and then we had a few of the other key and core names so in a way
(12:36) tell me how you feel if you feel well this is just the system this is just the way things are that's how things remain like this this is how we find ourselves in situations of geopolitical tension that cannot be amended or resolved war is good for business that's what one defense executive said at a London arms conference last month the very fact that there are arms conferences is perhaps an indication that our Global idea theology perhaps needs some Amendment if historic conflicts are going to have any hope any
(13:04) hope at all of resolution well I was at the arms conference and no one had any ideas that didn't lead to selling more arms it was almost as if the whole thing the whole system was geared towards selling arms actually it was an arms conference thing no I shouldn't have gone there that that was the wrong place to go for a solution and what the stock market reflected on Monday is Israel blockaded and bombarded the Gaza Strip in response to hamas's weekend attack that killed hundreds of Israelis there
(13:30) is nothing but prayer and love that I'm able to offer in response to such a horrible piece of text and a horrible piece of information Fox Business reported that shares of General Dynamics which make submarines and combat Vehicles Rose the most since March 20120 when it gained over 9% lock heed Martin's stock jump Monday was the biggest for the US's largest Defense Contractor on a non- earnings day since March 2020 narrowly topping the gains it notched immediately after Russia launched its for scale invasion of
(14:00) Ukraine Forbes noted Northrup Grumman shares also had their best day since 2020 if you were an investor if you are a Trader even if you're a ordinary person who dabbles in financial matters the fact is is that it would be sensible expedient wise Frugal fiduciary action to invest in these companies at this time and doesn't that suggest that we've entered a moral space that is baffling bedazzling bewitching and bewildering because if there is any action that could be taken in this time that's beneficial for a personal and financial
(14:34) perspective a war that's being fought territorially on spiritual values or at least religious edicts is somewhat out of line with the direction of power and finance shouldn't this financial component at least somehow be ameliorated emitted amended shouldn't this at least be resolv because I recognize that so much of what's happening is impossible to resolve without a degree in history a deep understanding of Ethics a willingness to think the unthinkable open-heartedness Transcendence of personal values
(15:06) tribalism deep understandable pain I mean this at least could be addressed commenting on the Bloodshed in Israel and gazer over the past few days Samir Samana senior Global Market strategist at Well's Fargo investment Institute told market watch that as countries need to replenish their weapons we do think defense companies will do very well so it's not all bad news sometimes I look at this and feel incredible despair and that there may not be a way out for us without almost inconceivable personal and Global change but over at World's
(15:35) Fargo they can see the bright side of all of this horror and death less than two months after Russia's Invasion last year William Harang a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft highlighted how such conflicts benefit the arms industry writing that the war will indeed be a bonanza for the likes of Ren and loed Martin last December in Forbes Haron warned against using the Russia Ukraine war to permanently EXP expand the weapons industry plans that have been floated so far include building new
(16:02) weapons factories dramatically boosting production of ammunition anti-tank weapons and other systems and easing oversight of weapons procurement let's ease that oversight people don't want someone peering at them when they're trying to sell weapons these changes will come at a cost over time will run into tens of billions of dollars above current spending plans and possibly more much more at a time when the Pentagon budget is soaring towards $1 trillion per year and debates about how to respond to the challenges posed by
(16:29) Russia and China are front and center it is more important than ever to make an independent assessment of the best path forward can we all agree on that ideally this would involve objective analysis by unbiased experts and policy makers grounded in a vigorous public conversation about how best to defend the country but more often not special interests override the national interest in decisions on how much to spend on the Pentagon and how those funds should be allocated even in this incredibly sensitive issue you have seen bombastic
(16:57) rhetoric designed to make you feel honesty and transparency and yet simultaneously it's impossible to ignore that very powerful industries that Lobby and spend a lot of money are profiting and people in Congress who are entrusted with the moral heart of a Nation are plainly acting in self-interest with so much that is difficult to discuss with so much that is uncertain let us plainly state that that kind of corruption should be ended one practice that introduces bias into the shaping of defense policy is the revolving door
(17:27) between the US government and the weapons industry the movement of retired senior officials from the Pentagon and the military services into the arms industry is a long-standing practice that raises serious questions about the appearance and reality of conflicts of interests mostly because employing well-connected ex-military officers can give weapons makers enormous unwarranted influence over the process of determining the size and shape of the Pentagon budget a 2021 report by the government accountability office found
(17:53) that 1700 senior government officials had taken positions in the arms industry over a 5-year period an average of well over 300 a year and a new report from the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft found that this practice is particularly pronounced among the top generals and Admirals in the past 5 years over 80% of retired fourstar generals and Admirals 26 of 32 went on to work in the arms sector as board members advisers lobbyists or Consultants a statistic of that nature is an indication that to a degree these
(18:22) are not separate institutions you have people in Congress investing in stocks and shares that they are in a position to influence the trajectory of you have a weapons industry that invests significantly in directing and biasing the policy of an entire nation you have senior officials in very powerful positions within incredibly powerful military organizations that have Financial ties to the tune of 86% of them working within the weapons industry these again during a very complex time are problems that could easily be
(18:51) resolved and solved the reason they're not being solved is because this is part of a system that while it is painful for so many people even though those of you that are not directly involved it's profitable for the people that matter and you have to ask yourself the question no matter what they say what is their moral position and is their moral position the platform that directs their action or is it possible there are other intentions and other agenda you can ask that broadly about geopolitical conflicts I understand as much as
(19:20) someone as abstracted as I am that this is a situation that almost interrogating and making inquiry of is too painful for people directly involved to countenance they simply want support for their own perspective but what we have to look at in addition to understanding those deep deep sensitivities that are beyond my comprehension is that if there is an Institutional and profitable component to Global conflicts Global conflicts are unlikely to be resolved let me know in the chat in the comments how you feel
(19:46) about that the most recent batch of retired fourstar generals they're not cookies are not only seeking employment with the big contractors they're also branching out to work for small and midsize companies that focus on cutting Edge technology like next Generation drones artificial intelligence and cyber security that's where International conflict and domestic conflict might conflate have you noticed that conditions appear to be moving in the direction of population control that has become increasingly militaristic
(20:17) certainly authoritarian have you noticed the militarization of police forces are they spending money on drones are they gaining access to military vehicles are protest laws being introduced our new online laws that prevent communication being introduced watch these Trends if the past is any guide this new influx of former military officials into the arms sector will distort Pentagon spending priorities and promote higher military budgets than would be the case absent their influence on behalf of their corporate employers as documented there
(20:43) are numerous examples of senior military officials who have advocated for dysfunctional weapons while in government and then gone on to work for the companies that produce those systems in addition former military officers have played Central roles in preventing the Pentagon from divesting itself of of weapons it no longer wants or needs the prevalence of this kind of activity is hard to track because of the limited information available about what retired military officers do once they join the arms industry those military officials
(21:10) were involved in a plan for a surprise party for your birthday and new ruined it there's too much at stake both in taxpayer dollars and our future security to let conflicts of interest and special interest politics shape the Pentagon budget the time for Congress to act to reduce the influence of the revolving door is now here's some information posted on X by unusual Wales about the number of Democrats and Republicans investing in oil energy and military industrial complex companies he posted here's every us politician in Congress
(21:40) Who currently holds stock positions that will directly benefit from the war in the Middle East and I will tell you now it is not a very short list it's I mean one would be too many but it's more than one substantially more than one so baffling terrifying and awful though this conflict is and has been for a very long while let us focus on what we can agree on together people in Congress should not be able to invest in companies that will benefit from military conflict let's end that practice let's have a government that's
(22:08) there to Serve the People certainly the domestic population if it's possible the population of the world that have an intention and a trajectory towards beneficial outcomes that are not biased by or in any way Guided by personal interest only then may we move forward in this new geopolitical climate in this state of Omni crisis where everywhere you look there are Wars in Europe that could escalate into Armageddon potential Wars in southeast China that could escalate into the apocalypse and in the Middle East a region historically
(22:40) troubled by the intervention of Imperial and Colonial Powers including Britain while these conflicts continue there should be no opportunity for profit it should simply be a complex difficult agonizing painful matter for all those involved and those of us that are not directly involved should do everything we can to bring about a peaceful solution even if it is in our own Hearts futile empty and shallow as that might sound in such a painful time for so many of you you all have my sympathy and love that's just what I think let me know
(23:08) what you think in the comments and chat have a look at that if you want remember 12 EST our content premieres on Rumble download the app you'll get notifications so you will know when we make content it's vital that you support us if you can by pressing the red awaken button it helps us it helps our voice to remain as free as possible it helps us to look for new ways to work together at a time of omn Crisis and global conflict more important than that is it more important than that well if we're ever
