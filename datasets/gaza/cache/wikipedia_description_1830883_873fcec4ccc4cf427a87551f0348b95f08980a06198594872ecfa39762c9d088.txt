 I have used the Wikipedia API to extract some description for a page but the description is a bit long: 

``` 
Page name: Nadine
Long description: Nadine may refer to:
```

Return a more concise description. Aim for a single sentence, roughly 2 or 3 lines. 


=== RESULTS ===

"Nadine" refers to a specific Wikipedia page name, with varying potential meanings.
