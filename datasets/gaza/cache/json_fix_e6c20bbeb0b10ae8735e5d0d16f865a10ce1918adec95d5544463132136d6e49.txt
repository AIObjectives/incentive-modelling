You are a JSON fixer. I will give you a string below which was produced 
by a buggy program and I want you to make small modifications to 
fix this string and make sure to return some syntactically-valid JSON. 

Here's the string:

{
  "stated_goals": [
    {"item": "Mediating negotiations between Hamas and Israel", "quote": "And there are intense negotiations going on, not directly between Hamas and Israel, because they don’t have formal relations. But mediated by Qatar, and to some extent, Egypt."}
  ], 
  "main_motivations": [
    {"item": "Securing the release of hostages", "quote": "There are talks to try and get some of them out. And we’ve already seen four released..."}
  ], 
  "possible_actions": [
    {"item": "Can facilitate in negotiations for hostage release", "quote": "But while those negotiations still have a chance of liberating some of the people who’ve been captured, it is thought that Israel is holding back from a ground invasion, lest it harm the chances of winning those people’s freedom."}
  ], 
  "good_scenarios": [], 
  "bad_scenarios": [], 
  "main_fears": [], 
  "resources": [], 
}
