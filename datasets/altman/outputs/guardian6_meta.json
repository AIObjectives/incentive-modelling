Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, quickly appointed Altman and the former OpenAI president, Greg Brockman, to a newly formed advanced AI team. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hinted at more OpenAI staff moving to Microsoft. Altman's firing caused considerable reaction among OpenAI staff and within Silicon Valley. Talks to rehire him failed, leading to his shift to Microsoft, and discussions about OpenAI governance, safety, and commercial prospects.",
