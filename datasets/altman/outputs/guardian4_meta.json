  "summary": "Sam Altman was fired from OpenAI by the board for not being candid, leading to attempts to reinstate him, mediated by Satya Nadella of Microsoft. Altman insisted on the board's removal for his return, which did not happen. Instead, Microsoft hired Altman and Brockman after Emmett Shear was appointed as interim CEO of OpenAI. This event leds to a potential talent drain at OpenAI, with senior researchers and staff indicating they may follow Altman.",
