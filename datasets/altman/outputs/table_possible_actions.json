OpenAI declined to comment but internally acknowledged the letter and a project named Q*. There were also concerns over commercializing technological advances without fully understanding their consequences. After Altman's firing, more than 700 employees threatened to quit. The Q* model showed potential in solving basic mathematical problems, indicating significant advances towards artificial general intelligence (AGI).
