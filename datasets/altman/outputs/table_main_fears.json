This led to a lack of confidence in his leadership, and subsequent replacement by Mira Murati as interim CEO. Greg Brockman stepped down as chair of the board but remains OpenAI president. Altman's firing surprised employees, was followed by an emergency all-hands meeting, and impacted Microsoft's stocks.

It reveals motivations behind key decisions and offers a glimpse into power shifts and internal communications.",
          "summary": "Sam Altman was fired by OpenAI for alleged communication issues and replaced by Emmett Shear. Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, quickly appointed Altman and the former OpenAI president, Greg Brockman, to a newly formed advanced AI team. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hinted at more OpenAI staff moving to Microsoft. Altman's firing caused considerable reaction among OpenAI staff and within Silicon Valley. Talks to rehire him failed, leading to his shift to Microsoft, and discussions about OpenAI governance, safety, and commercial prospects.",
