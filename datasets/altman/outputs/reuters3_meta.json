It references power dynamics within the organization and hints at the governance structure that might have motivated board decisions. This information is central to understanding the second and third research goals.",
  "summary": "Following the sudden termination of CEO Sam Altman from OpenAI, investors are considering legal actions against the board due to fears of significant financial losses. OpenAI's unique corporate structure—with a for-profit segment controlled by a nonprofit—grants employees significant leverage, possibly more than venture capitalists. Despite investor concerns, legal experts speculate that a lawsuit would be challenging due to the broad legal latitude companies possess for business decisions.",
