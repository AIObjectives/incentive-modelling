  "summary": "A letter from OpenAI researchers to the board, warning about a potentially threatening AI breakthrough, was a key factor in the firing of CEO Sam Altman. OpenAI declined to comment but internally acknowledged the letter and a project named Q*. There were also concerns over commercializing technological advances without fully understanding their consequences. After Altman's firing, more than 700 employees threatened to quit. The Q* model showed potential in solving basic mathematical problems, indicating significant advances towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). Researchers also warned about the inherent dangers posed by intelligent machines.",
