This led to a lack of confidence in his leadership, and subsequent replacement by Mira Murati as interim CEO. Greg Brockman stepped down as chair of the board but remains OpenAI president. Altman's firing surprised employees, was followed by an emergency all-hands meeting, and impacted Microsoft's stocks.
