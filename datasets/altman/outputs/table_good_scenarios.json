It reveals motivations behind key decisions and offers a glimpse into power shifts and internal communications.",

Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, quickly appointed Altman and the former OpenAI president, Greg Brockman, to a newly formed advanced AI team. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hinted at more OpenAI staff moving to Microsoft. Altman's firing caused considerable reaction among OpenAI staff and within Silicon Valley.
