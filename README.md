Opnboarding

1. See project plan here (read about OAA)
   https://docs.google.com/document/d/19E3qMEOZ7PAraJA6ezyBCN0W0NOOh-gphpwcQ01uVi4/edit#heading=h.cp1k54wpy0cq

2. Review code, and consider changing the following:

- folder structure for different domains
- visualising all sources for one domain in one place
- better UI with fixed column header, ways too see multiple sources and quotes
- iterate on prompts, using gpt-4-turbo (no more need for fixed_json)
- add more data...

3. first MVP to include in grant proposal...

- one domain, example of outputs (our table)
- custom GPTs fed with raw data and instruction...
