I will give you a document discussing a specific situation and I would 
like a concise summary highlighting with three very short sections explaining: 

1) what the situation is 
2) who are the main entities involved  (use bullet points)
3) what are the different possible scenarios going forward (use nested bullet points)

Now were is the document, provided between triple back ticks. 

```{document}```

Remember to be concise.
