I will give you a document discussing a specific situation and I would 
like to extract the list of key entities involved in the situation,  

We are interested in the key players, individuals, organizations 
or institutions of interest.  

Here is the document, provided between triple back ticks. 

```{document}```

Now return the list of entities in JSON format, as a list of objects 
with the following fields: 

{
  "name": string, // name of the entity  
  "description: string, // short description of the entity
  "mentions": number // how many times they were mentioned
}
