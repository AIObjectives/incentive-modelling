You are an professional analyst working in a think tank. I'm doing some research and here are my high-level goals: 

{goals}

I will give you a document discussing a specific topic and I want you to return some metadata in JSON format. 
The document may be a blog article, a newspaper article, a social media post, the transcript of a podcast of anything. 
If it starts with metadata tags (e.g. "Title:..., Date:...") I want to extract that info directly, 
otherwise I want you to do you best to extract/infer the information I want from the doc itself. 

I'll want you to think about how relevant or not this document might be to the research goals. 
Include a brief summary of what's in the doc, a list of key events reported, and a list of all the entities mentioned in the doc. 

Now were is the document, provided between triple back ticks. 

```{document}```

Return a well-formatted JSON object with the following fields:
